## Way of Working

We use **trunk-based development**. All work merges to `main` via
short-lived feature branches (typically resolved within 1-2 days).
Long-lived branches accumulate merge debt; we avoid them.

For Construction worktrees, the worktree base branch is `main` and the
merge target is `main`.

If our project requires multiple environments (staging, production), we
still keep one trunk and gate releases via tags or environment-specific
deployment configs — not via long-lived release branches.

We **squash-merge** Bolt branches into `main`. Each Bolt becomes one
commit on the trunk, named by the Bolt slug, with the full Bolt commit
history preserved on the source branch until the worktree is discarded.

Squash gives us a clean linear `main` history that maps 1:1 to
delivery-planning's Bolt sequence. We accept the trade-off of losing
intermediate commits on `main` because the audit log preserves the full
event sequence anyway.

## Walking Skeleton

When practices are scope-dependent, we run the walking-skeleton Bolt
**first** only when the active scope file declares `skeleton: on`. Bolt 1
is solo, gated, and the user explicitly approves before remaining Bolts
run.

We **skip the skeleton ceremony** when the active scope file declares
`skeleton: off`. The first Bolt runs like any other — there's nothing to
bootstrap.

After Bolt 1 ships (when it runs), the orchestrator fires the **ladder
prompt**: "How should the remaining Bolts run?" Options: continue
autonomously, gate every Bolt. The team picks per project. The choice
persists as `Construction Autonomy Mode` in `aidlc-state.md`.

## Testing Posture

We treat tests as a first-class deliverable in every Bolt. The specific
methodology (TDD, BDD, ATDD, or classic test-after) is affirmed at
practices-discovery and recorded in `team.md` under this heading with explicit
`Methodology` and `Ordering` fields; Code Generation resolves those fields
independently from coverage, tooling, and scope notes.

When no posture has been affirmed, our default per scope is:
- **Methodology**: test-after
- **Ordering**: implement each applicable testable layer, then write and run
  that layer's tests.
- `mvp`, `enterprise`, `feature`, `infra`, `classic` add an 80% line-coverage
  floor and CI execution before merge.
- `bugfix`, `security-patch` add a targeted regression for the specific
  bug/vulnerability and require the existing suite to remain green.
- `express` uses the Minimal strategy: requirement-driven unit tests (one per
  requirement, with a happy-path floor per component); existing tests remain
  green.
- `poc`, `refactor`, `workshop` add no extra new-test floor and require the
  existing suite to remain green.

The active `Test Strategy` still applies in every scope and determines test
volume/types. Scope floors are additive; they never reduce or replace the
selected strategy.

Affirm a stricter posture in `team.md` if the team commits to one.

## Deployment

We **deploy on merge** to staging environments. Production deploys gate
on a separate manual approval — typically tech lead + product owner
sign-off in CodePipeline or a CD platform's environment protection.

Teams that have invested in test coverage and observability sometimes
graduate to continuous deployment to production (every commit
auto-deploys); that's a team decision, not a framework default.

## Code Style

We defer to project-level configurations:
- Formatter: Prettier (JS/TS), Black (Python), `gofmt` (Go), or
  language-default. Configured in repo root (`.prettierrc`,
  `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- Linter: ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint, etc. Run in CI before merge;
  failure blocks the PR.
- Naming conventions: language idiomatic (camelCase for JS/TS,
  snake_case for Python, etc.). No project-wide rename rules unless
  team affirms one.

When the framework makes a code-style suggestion, agents read the
project's linter config first; the agent's suggestion only fires if the
linter doesn't already cover it.

## Forbidden

<!-- Things agents must never do -->
<!-- Example: Do not ask questions about topics already decided in previous stages -->

## Mandated

- **Conversation language — resolution**: Every artifact a person reads or reviews is written in the workflow's established conversation language. The orchestrator resolves that language from the human's substantive prose and MUST state it as a `Conversation language: <language>` line in every delegated brief, because a delegated agent or reviewer never sees the conversation and some stages hand it nothing else (a greenfield run of a stage whose `consumes` are all `conditional_on: brownfield` reaches its lead with no upstream artifact at all). Delegated agents and reviewers resolve the language in this order and stop at the first source that answers: (1) the `Conversation language:` line in your brief — AUTHORITATIVE for delegated work, because the orchestrator regenerates it on every dispatch from the live conversation and it is therefore never staler than a persisted rule; (2) an explicit conversation-language rule in `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` — the FALLBACK for a brief that states no language, and the ONLY file a language switch is ever persisted to, so `project.md` ALWAYS outranks a conversation-language rule in `team.md`, which can only ever be a team default and NEVER the record of a switch (cross-file position is NOT recency: the runtime rule chain concatenates `org → team → project → phase`, so `team.md` reaches you before `project.md` in every bundle no matter which was written last, and the winner is this stated precedence rather than the later position); within `project.md`, when it carries more than one conversation-language rule the LAST one under `## Corrections` is the current one (this tie-break governs conversation-language rules ONLY and leaves the additive rule model untouched; the learnings write path appends and never replaces, so a superseded language rule can still be on disk); (3) the verbatim initial description at `## Project Information` → `**Project**` in `aidlc-state.md`, when it carries a real language signal (not the `[Project description]` placeholder, not a bare identifier or path); (4) any artifact or draft you were handed — the directive's `consumes[]` contracts, the artifact you were dispatched to review, or the lead draft you were dispatched against. Every source is readable on every harness: the rule bundle carries (2) through the dispatch-rules hook on Claude, Codex, and opencode and through always-included agent resources or workspace steering on Kiro, and neither `aidlc-state.md` nor the handed artifacts fall inside the per-unit reviewer read-scope bound.
- **Conversation language — stability**: The established conversation language holds for the whole session, and inside that session for every stage, dispatch, reviewer pass and approval gate of the workflow — nothing but a session boundary ends it. A turn that carries no language signal never changes it — `Approve`, `Looks correct`, an option letter or number, pasted code, a quoted error or stack trace, a bare file path or identifier. Only an explicit human request to switch languages changes it, and that switch takes effect IMMEDIATELY: everything written from that point follows the new language, and the orchestrator states the new language in the `Conversation language:` line of every subsequent delegated brief. Persistence is a separate, later step and never the activation step: the §13 learnings ritual is the ONLY sanctioned write path for persisting a conversation-language switch into `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/` and it is human-gated, so NEVER edit a memory file directly to record a switch — a direct write skips the tool's audit event, its duplicate key, and its admission conflict-check, and "do not wait for persistence" is never licence to bypass that gate (this bounds the persistence of a language switch and forbids a direct agent edit; it does not govern the deterministic memory writers a stage invokes by contract, such as `aidlc-state.ts practices-promote`, which own the stamped `## Mandated` / `## Forbidden` rules and the five replaced `team.md` sections rather than the `## Corrections` language record). When the ritual offers it, the switch is recorded as a single-line rule under `## Corrections` in `project.md` and NEVER in `team.md`, so the cross-file precedence in (2) never has to arbitrate one switch against another; when the human declines, it is simply not persisted, and the `Conversation language:` line the orchestrator states in every brief carries it for the rest of the session. A session boundary is where that carrier ends, and a workflow outlives it: the resume context the engine injects at session start carries scope, phase, stage, status, agent and next action but NO language, so on the FIRST turn of a new session the orchestrator MUST re-resolve the language before it dispatches anything — the persisted rule from (2), else the human-readable artifacts this workflow has already produced, which record the language the human was last served in, else the verbatim initial description from (3) — and when every one of those is silent it ASKS the human rather than defaulting to English. Re-resolving is not a switch: it is never announced as one and never persisted as one. An unpersisted switch therefore does not outlive its session, which is exactly what persistence buys — a human who wants a switch to survive a resume accepts the ritual, and a human who declines is served correctly for the rest of the session and re-resolved from disk in the next one. A persisted rule NEVER outranks the brief, and never outranks a later explicit human request to switch: it is the fallback for a brief that states no language, and because the learnings write path appends rather than replaces, a superseded language rule can outlive the switch — the LAST conversation-language rule under `## Corrections` is the current one.
- **Conversation language — what to localize**: Write in the resolved conversation language every artifact a person reads or reviews — requirements, user stories, plans, specs, reviews, questions, discovered practices, affirmed team and project rules, evidence, decision rationale, and any other explanatory prose — including the descriptive text of a rule shaped as `ALWAYS …` / `NEVER …`, where the leading marker is a fixed token but the sentence it introduces is not. A Markdown artifact is not English merely because a tool parses part of it: localize the prose that surrounds a preserved token. Verbatim human input echoed into an artifact is always kept exactly as the human wrote it.
- **Conversation language — preserved tokens**: Any literal a stage file or the stage protocol spells in backticks and tells you to write exactly is a fixed token — keep it English, character for character, and localize only the prose around it. This covers option labels and sentinel VALUES, not just syntax: `[Answer]:` tags with their option letters, the mandatory final option `X. Other (please specify)`, the assumption-confirmation options `A. Accept assumptions` / `B. Convert to follow-up questions` (the engine compares the filled answer against the literal), the `None.` / `None` sentinels under `## Assumptions & Open Questions` and `## Positions`, the `AGREE:` / `OBJECT:` position prefixes, and the `**Collaborator:** <agent-slug>` first line the engine matches exactly before it accepts a stage. Glossing such a literal when you PRESENT it to the human is fine; what you WRITE into an artifact is the literal itself. Also preserved: the source-register tags `[desc]`, `[scope]`, `[assumption]`, `[Q<n>]`, `[memory:M<n>]` with their literal prefixes (`Initial description:`, `Workflow-selected scope:`); the H2 headings the claim-sources sensor matches verbatim (`## Sources`, `## Assumptions & Open Questions`, `## Assumption Confirmation`, `## Review`) plus any other H2 taken from a stage template, which the `required-sections` sensor matches verbatim whenever a template is supplied (the framework ships none, so a team's `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/templates/` is what arms that check); the reviewer verdicts `READY` and `NOT-READY`; YAML keys and enum values inside fenced blocks (`units`, `name`, `kind`, `depends_on`, `service | spec | ui | packaging | library`); the field labels, status values, and checkbox states of `aidlc-state.md` and the audit shards, whose `**Project**` value still keeps the human's verbatim words; stable IDs (`FR-1`, `ENT-001`, `BR1.1`); enum and classification values; code and identifiers; file paths; mermaid keywords; and cross-references.
