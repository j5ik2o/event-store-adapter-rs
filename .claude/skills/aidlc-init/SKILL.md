# AI-DLC — start a workflow (birth the first intent)

Start a fresh AI-DLC workflow. The workspace shell ships in `dist/` (no setup
command), and the engine auto-births the first intent when you describe what to
build — this skill is opt-in packaging over that birth move. Initialization is a
PHASE, not a single stage — it mints the intent, detects the workspace
(greenfield/brownfield), and builds `aidlc-state.md` together, in one
deterministic call. There is no per-init-stage runner because an init stage has
no standalone meaning.

## Steps

1. Birth the intent (run the initialization phase). Parse the user's
   `$ARGUMENTS`: forward any recognized flags
   (`--scope <name>`/`--depth <level>`/`--test-strategy <level>`)
   as-is, and pass any freeform description text via `--arguments "<text>"`
   (`intent-create` reads the description from the `--arguments` flag, NOT a
   positional — forwarding it bare would silently drop it). ALSO derive a short
   **`--label`**: a 2-3 word kebab-case essence of what's being built
   (`"I would like to build a simple calculator application"` → `--label
   "simple calc"`). The label becomes the readable, date-prefixed record dir name
   (`<YYMMDD>-simple-calc`); the full `--arguments` text is preserved separately
   in the audit + state. Omit `--label` only when there is no description (the
   tool then falls back to the scope token):

   ```bash
   bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create --scope <scope> --arguments "<description>" --label "<2-3 word essence>"
   ```

   Pass the user's `--scope <name>` when they named one; otherwise omit
   `--scope` — the tool resolves the implicit default itself
   (`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE`, else `classic`). If the user gave neither a
   scope nor a description, do not run a bare `intent-create`: ask what they
   want to build or which scope to use. When only a scope was supplied, omit
   `--arguments` and `--label`. Print the tool's output and stop. This does
   not advance a stage; run `/aidlc` afterwards to continue.
