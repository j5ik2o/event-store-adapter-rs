# AI-DLC - compose a workflow plan

Force the adaptive composer on a task. This is packaging over
`/aidlc compose ...` - it does not add a second entry point; the engine
recognizes the compose request and names the composer dispatch, and the
conductor runs the same forwarding loop as `/aidlc`.

## Steps

1. Forward the user's `$ARGUMENTS` into the engine with the leading
   `compose` verb (pass `--report <path>` / `--new-scope` through as-is):

   ```bash
   bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next compose $ARGUMENTS
   ```

2. Act on the directive exactly as the `aidlc` skill's forwarding loop
   describes (the composer-dispatch print names the composer agent; render
   its proposal and hold the approve/edit/reject gate). From here the flow IS
   the `/aidlc` flow - continue its loop until the directive says stop.
