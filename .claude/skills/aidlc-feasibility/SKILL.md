# AI-DLC Stage Runner — feasibility

Run the `feasibility` stage on its own. This is opt-in packaging over
`/aidlc --stage feasibility --single`; the same stage is always reachable via
that flag without this skill.

## Steps

1. Ask the engine for the single-stage directive:

   ```bash
   bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --stage feasibility --single
   ```

   The engine emits one `run-stage` directive for `feasibility` (carrying the
   lead agent, the resolved consumes/produces paths, the rules and sensors in
   context, and — on this first directive — the conductor persona). Run the stage
   exactly as the directive describes; do not load the conductor persona by hand,
   the engine delivers it.

2. Before acting on the directive, read
   `.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md`. Then read every
   `.claude/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-<module>.md` named by
   `directive.protocol_modules`. Load every listed module before reading the
   stage body or running its topology; skip only a module already loaded earlier
   in this session.

3. When the stage's work is done, commit the single-stage record:

   ```bash
   bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --single --stage feasibility --result completed
   ```

   This records a STAGE_STARTED / STAGE_COMPLETED pair under a synthetic workflow
   id and stops. It NEVER writes the main workflow's `Current Stage` — a
   single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main
   workflow).
