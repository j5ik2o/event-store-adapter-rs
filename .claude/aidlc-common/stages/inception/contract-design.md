# Contract Design

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

Define the formal contracts the system must honour so teams can build in parallel with confidence. A contract is a formal agreement across a boundary: what data crosses it, in what shape, via what protocol, and what happens when things go wrong. Two kinds of boundary qualify:

- **Inter-unit boundaries** — the agreement between a provider unit and a consumer unit inside the system. Treat each like a B2B agreement between two teams in two companies: it must be right from the start, because a wrong contract turns integration into a rework disaster.
- **Public/external API boundaries** — the agreement between a unit and a consumer *outside* the system (another team, a partner, the public internet). A single-unit system with no inter-unit edges still needs this contract pinned before Code Generation when it exposes such an API; there is no other stage that owns the external API specification.

This stage runs once per workflow (not per unit) — it maps the whole set of boundaries at once, using the dependency DAG from Units Generation to know which units talk to each other, plus each unit's externally consumed surface for public API contracts.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Agent Personas

Load aidlc-architect-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-architect-agent.md` and knowledge from `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-architect-agent/`.
Load aidlc-aws-platform-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-aws-platform-agent.md` and knowledge from `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-aws-platform-agent/` for integration-mechanism awareness (sync REST vs. async messaging vs. shared store).

### Step 2: Load Prior Context

- Read `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md` (unit definitions and kinds)
- Read `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work-dependency.md` (the dependency DAG — every edge is a candidate contract)
- Read `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md` (if produced) — the entity shapes inform payload design
- Read `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` (if produced) — NFRs shape SLAs and error budgets

### Step 3: Create Contract Plan with Questions

Create `<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-design-questions.md` with context-appropriate questions using [Answer]: tag format:
- Public/external API surface (which units expose an API consumed outside the system, and its shape) — the single-unit trigger for this stage
- Integration mechanism per boundary (synchronous REST/HTTP, async event/message, shared schema, gRPC, etc.)
- Contract ownership (which unit owns each spec)
- Versioning and breaking-change policy
- Error, timeout, and retry behaviour at each boundary

### Step 4: Collect and Analyze Answers

Collect answers following stage-protocol.md §3 question flow (offer interaction mode choice, collect answers, write back to file).
- MANDATORY ambiguity analysis: scan for vague language, contradictions, missing details
- Create follow-up questions if ANY ambiguity found
- Resolve all ambiguities before proceeding

### Step 5: Generate the Contract Summary

Create `<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-summary.md`. This single artifact carries both the human-readable overview and the contract specs themselves.

**Contracts table** — one row per boundary (inter-unit and public/external):

`| # | Provider Unit | Consumer | Mechanism | Owner |`

For an external boundary, name the outside consumer (e.g. `External: partner API`, `External: public web`) in the Consumer column.

**Per-contract spec** — for each boundary, a fenced code block carrying the actual spec in the appropriate format:

- a fenced ```yaml OpenAPI block for synchronous REST/HTTP contracts
- a fenced ```yaml AsyncAPI block for event-driven/message-based contracts
- a fenced ```yaml shared-schema block for shared database or shared model contracts
- any other contract format appropriate to the integration mechanism

**Contract ownership rules** — a short list stating who owns each spec, how breaking changes are agreed, and how additive changes stay safe (consumers ignore unknown fields).

**Open questions** — a table of unresolved contract points and which unit each blocks:
`| Contract | Question | Blocks |`

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage contract-design --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 7: Present Completion & Request Approval

Use stage-protocol.md completion template with completion emoji: :handshake:
- Summary of contracts defined (count, mechanisms, ownership)
- Review path: `<record>/inception/contract-design/`
- Structured approval question with options: Approve (continue to next stage) / Request Changes

## Sensors

This stage's output is a markdown artefact under `<record>/inception/contract-design/`.

The imported sensors check that output:

- **`required-sections`** verifies the output contains the registry default (≥2 H2 headings). Failure mode: missing headings emit `SENSOR_FAILED` with detail at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/<stage-slug>/required-sections-<iso>.md`.
- **`upstream-coverage`** verifies the output prose references each artefact declared in this stage's `consumes:` frontmatter. Failure mode: missing upstream references emit `SENSOR_FAILED` listing each unreferenced artefact (this stage consumes `unit-of-work`, `unit-of-work-dependency`, `components`, `requirements`).

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → a practice line under the routed heading in
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` (default) or `team.md` (promoted)
- Verification check → new manifest at `.claude/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

Even when nothing surfaces, still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question from stage-protocol.md section 13. Do not infer "Nothing to add." Only after the human answers that question may you proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
