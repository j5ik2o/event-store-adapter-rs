# Reverse Engineering

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

This stage runs `mode: pipeline` (stage-protocol-ensemble.md §5): a two-link chain in
which each link advances the work product directly. The developer lead (link
1) scans and returns structured results; the architect (link 2, the final
link) synthesizes those results and writes the 9 artifacts. The final link
leaving the `produces[]` artifacts complete plus both tool-owned link receipts
is the pipeline contract — no contribution files on pipeline stages. On resume,
read `directive.pipeline.completed` and dispatch only the first missing link;
multi-repo entries are qualified as `<repo>:<agent>`.

## Steps

### Step 1: Check Conditions

Read `<record>/aidlc-state.md` to confirm:
- Project type is brownfield

If the project is not brownfield, run
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage reverse-engineering --result skipped --reason "<reason>"`.
The engine records the skip and advances to the next in-scope stage.

#### Resolve the intent's repo set (multi-repo)

This stage runs **per repo** the intent touches. Resolve the complete repo set
from the intent's registry row before making any reuse or scan decision:

1. Read the active intent's `repos` array from
   `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/intents/intents.json` (the row whose `uuid`/`slug`
   matches the active intent). This is the set captured at intent birth (an explicit
   `--repos a,b` or sibling auto-discovery).
2. **Single-repo / unrecorded:** if `repos` is absent, empty, or has exactly one
   entry, RE runs once against the lone repo - the same flow as before. (An
   unrecorded set means the workspace root is itself the single repo.)
3. **Multi-repo:** if `repos` has more than one entry, resolve the Step 1 guard
   decision for every repo, then run Steps 2-3 once for each repo selected for a
   scan. Scan that repo's sibling directory (`<workspace>/<repo>/`) and write its
   9 artifacts to the directory `codekb-path --repo <repo>` prints (the
   space-level `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`; see Step 3). Each
   repo's codekb is independent, so selected scans may run as parallel subagents.

In the steps below, `<repo>` is the repository whose decision or scan is being
processed.

For each repo selected for scanning, Steps 2-3 are one independent receipt
chain. Add `--repo <repo>` to both receipt commands when the intent registers
multiple repos; omit it for a single/unrecorded repo.

#### Rerun guard: check each existing store before scanning

The codekb is a space-level store shared across intents; a rerun REPLACES it.
For every repo in the resolved set, run the read-only check:

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts codekb-scope-diff --repo <repo>
```

- **NO_STORE** - first scan for this repo. Proceed to Step 2; no question.
- **CURRENT** - the store's analyzed paths are unchanged since it was built.
  If the recorded coverage plausibly serves this intent's area, present the
  reuse question below. If this intent clearly targets code OUTSIDE the
  store's analyzed paths, skip the reuse option and ask rescan vs focused only.
- **STALE / UNVERIFIED / UNKNOWN_SCOPE** - the store's knowledge is out of
  date, unverifiable, or predates scope tracking. Present the rescan question
  below WITHOUT the reuse option.

Reuse question (CURRENT + coverage fits the intent) - fold the tool's output
(store intent, analyzed paths) into the prompt so the human decides on
evidence:

```question
prompt: "An up-to-date code knowledge base exists for <repo> (built by intent <store-intent>; verified unchanged). Deep coverage: <analyzed paths>. Reuse it, or rescan?"
header: "Code KB"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Reuse existing knowledge base"
    description: "Skip the scan; downstream stages read the current store as-is"
  - label: "Full rescan"
    description: "Rebuild the store covering the whole repo (replaces all 9 artifacts)"
  - label: "Focused scan"
    description: "Scan only this intent's area - the store will describe ONLY that area afterward"
```

Rescan question (STALE / UNVERIFIED / UNKNOWN_SCOPE, or CURRENT with coverage
that does not fit) - include the verdict line in the prompt:

```question
prompt: "A code knowledge base exists for <repo> but <verdict summary - e.g. its analyzed paths have changed since it was built / it does not cover this intent's area>. Rescanning replaces it. How should the scan run?"
header: "Code KB"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Full rescan"
    description: "Rebuild the store covering the whole repo (replaces all 9 artifacts)"
  - label: "Focused scan"
    description: "Scan only this intent's area - prior deep knowledge outside it is discarded (recoverable from git history)"
```

Record one decision per repo: reuse, full rescan, or focused scan. A reuse
decision does NOT report or advance the stage while another repository may
still need scanning. On a scan choice, also record its breadth; that choice
sets the developer brief, and Step 3's scope block records what the scan
actually covered.

On an ordinary workflow run, immediately after each human reuse decision,
record that repo's current-attempt exemption:

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-state.ts reuse-artifact reverse-engineering --decision keep --artifacts "<codekb-path output>" --repo <repo>
```

Use one row per reused registered repo. For an unrecorded single-repo workspace,
omit `--repo`; for an isolated run, do not mint this main-workflow reuse row.
The all-reuse routing below is unchanged.

Only after every repository decision has been resolved:

- If every repo is reused on an ordinary workflow run, report the stage as
  skipped exactly once:
  `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage reverse-engineering --result skipped --reason "codekb reuse: all resolved stores CURRENT, human chose reuse"`.
- If every repo is reused on an isolated run (`directive.single === true`), do
  NOT call the main-workflow skipped report. Return the reused-repositories
  summary to the orchestrator's isolated stage-runner branch; it owns the
  single `report --single --stage "reverse-engineering" --result completed`.
- If any repo needs scanning, do not report a skip. Proceed to Steps 2-3 for
  only the full/focused scan repos; leave each reused repo's store unchanged.
  On an isolated run, add `--single` to every link receipt command below.

### Step 2: Developer Code Scan

Delegate to Task tool with aidlc-developer-agent:
- subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent"
- The agent persona and knowledge are loaded automatically. Do NOT manually inject the persona.
- Include workspace state from aidlc-state.md as context

Brief the developer with the scan breadth chosen at the Step 1 guard (full
rescan = the whole repo; focused scan = the intent's area, named explicitly in
the brief) and require the scan results' Scan Coverage section (re-artifacts.md
template) to list what was actually analyzed deeply vs skimmed.

For each repo selected for scanning, the developer scans `<repo>`'s codebase
(the sibling dir `<workspace>/<repo>/`; for a single-repo intent this is the
whole codebase) for:
- All packages, modules, and their purposes
- Build systems, configuration, and dependency relationships
- External and internal APIs (endpoints, contracts, methods)
- Frameworks, libraries, and their versions
- Test directories, test frameworks, coverage configuration
- Code quality indicators (linting, CI/CD, documentation)
- Technical debt signals

Developer returns structured scan results following the Developer Code Scan
Template in
`.claude/knowledge/aidlc-developer-agent/re-artifacts.md`.

After the developer return has been read and preserved for the next link, mint
link 1 before dispatching the architect:

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-log.ts link --stage reverse-engineering --link aidlc-developer-agent [--repo <repo>] [--single]
```

### Step 3: Architect Synthesis

Delegate to Task tool with aidlc-architect-agent:
- subagent_type="aidlc-architect-agent"
- The agent persona and knowledge are loaded automatically. Do NOT manually inject the persona.
- Pass the complete developer scan results as context
- Include workspace state from aidlc-state.md

Architect synthesizes scan results into 9 artifacts:
1. **business-overview.md** — Business domain, purpose, key functionality
2. **architecture.md** — System architecture, patterns, component relationships (with Mermaid diagrams). MUST include Interaction Diagrams section depicting how business transactions are implemented across components (sequence or flow diagrams).
3. **code-structure.md** — Package/module organization, file classification, code patterns
4. **api-documentation.md** — External and internal API surfaces, endpoints, contracts
5. **component-inventory.md** — Complete component list with responsibilities and dependencies
6. **technology-stack.md** — Languages, frameworks, libraries with versions
7. **dependencies.md** — External dependencies, internal cross-package dependencies
8. **code-quality-assessment.md** — Test coverage, linting, CI/CD, documentation quality, tech debt
9. **reverse-engineering-timestamp.md** - Records when reverse engineering was performed (date, commit hash if available) and MUST end with the structured `## Scope of Analysis` block from the re-artifacts.md template, filled from the developer's Scan Coverage - what the run ACTUALLY analyzed deeply, not what was aspired to. This is the freshness/staleness marker the Step 1 rerun guard reads. For the block's `fingerprint:` line, run the mint command with the analyzed paths (comma-separated) and paste its output verbatim:

   ```
   bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts codekb-scope-diff --repo <repo> --mint --paths <analyzed paths>
   ```

**Resolve the write directory with the engine, do NOT compose the path yourself.**
Run the read-only tool

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts codekb-path --repo <repo>
```

(omit `--repo` for a single/unrecorded repo — the engine resolves the repo name).
It prints ONE line: the exact directory, e.g. `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`.

**Overwrite backstop - run BEFORE writing (the compare needs the store still
un-replaced).** When the Step 1 guard found an existing store (any verdict but
NO_STORE), write the new timestamp content to
`<record>/inception/reverse-engineering/scope-draft-<repo>.md` (one draft per
repo; NOT the timestamp filename - record-dir placement checks key on the
artifact stems) and run

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts codekb-scope-diff --repo <repo> --compare <record>/inception/reverse-engineering/scope-draft-<repo>.md
```

Keep the output keyed by `<repo>` for Step 5's completion summary. This is the
deterministic check that the scan delivered the breadth chosen at Step 1 - a
focused run after a "Full rescan" choice surfaces here as NARROWER, before
approval. Delete that repo's `scope-draft-<repo>.md` immediately after
preserving the compare output; scope drafts are temporary and MUST NOT remain
in the intent record.

Write all 9 artifacts into the directory `codekb-path` printed - verbatim,
creating it if absent. This is the durable per-repo code knowledge base, a
space-level store shared across every intent in the space. Never substitute
the intent slug, the record dir, or a hand-composed path for what the tool
prints.

After the architect return has been read and all 9 artifacts for that repo are
present, mint the final-link receipt:

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-log.ts link --stage reverse-engineering --link aidlc-architect-agent [--repo <repo>] [--single]
```

Do not report completion until every selected repo's chain has both receipts.

### Step 4: Completion Handoff

After every selected repo scan has completed, hand completion to
`stage-protocol.md` exactly once via
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage reverse-engineering --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 5: Present Completion & Request Approval

Use stage-protocol.md completion template:
- Announcement with completion summary
- Summary of all 9 artifacts produced **per repo** (for a multi-repo intent, list
  each repo's `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` set — the directory
  `codekb-path --repo <repo>` printed in Step 3); identify reused repos whose
  existing stores were left unchanged
- **For every repo whose Step 3 compare returned NARROWER**, the summary MUST
  carry a repo-labeled warning before the question, quoting that repo's tool
  discard list verbatim:

  ```
  WARNING for <repo>: this scan covered less than the store it replaced. Deep
  knowledge of the following was discarded (recoverable from git history):
  <discarded paths and components from the compare output>
  Choose Request Changes to widen the scan instead.
  ```

  (COVERS, or no prior store, needs no warning line.)
- Review path: `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` for each repo in the set
- Structured approval question with options: Approve (continue to Requirements Analysis) / Request Changes. If any repo returned NARROWER, the Approve option's description must say which stores were replaced by narrower scans (e.g. "Accept the narrower stores for <repos>; continue to Requirements Analysis").

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` (the directory `codekb-path --repo <repo>` resolves).

The imported sensors check those outputs:

- **`required-sections`** verifies the output contains the registry default (≥2 H2 headings). Failure mode: missing headings emit `SENSOR_FAILED` with detail at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/<stage-slug>/required-sections-<iso>.md`.
- **`upstream-coverage`** verifies the output prose references each artefact declared in this stage's `consumes:` frontmatter. This stage declares no upstream artefacts; the sensor still runs but reports zero unreferenced inputs by default.

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → a practice line under the routed heading in
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` (default) or `team.md` (promoted)
- Verification check → new manifest at `.claude/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

Even when nothing surfaces, still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question from stage-protocol.md section 13. Do not infer "Nothing to add." Only after the human answers that question may you proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
