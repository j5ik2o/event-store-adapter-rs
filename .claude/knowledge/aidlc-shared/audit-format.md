# Audit Event Taxonomy

**Event names MUST match this table exactly.** Do not invent new event types. For stage completions, ALWAYS use `STAGE_COMPLETED` — do not substitute stage-specific names like "Requirements Analysis Complete" or "Code Generated".

Stage lifecycle is report-owned: the conductor requests gate, revision,
completion, and skip outcomes through `tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report`.
The state tool entries below are the engine's internal atomic emitters, not
commands a stage or conductor invokes directly.

> See [`docs/reference/12-state-machine.md`](../../../../docs/reference/12-state-machine.md) for the state transitions that emit each event. Events marked `✓` are MANDATORY and asserted by `tests/feature/t48-audit-event-emitters.sh`.

## Naming Convention

All event names follow `SUBJECT_PAST_VERB` — every event answers "what happened?"

## Emitter-Owned Fields

The structured renderer writes exactly one `Timestamp` and one `Event` line per
block; callers must not supply either field. For compatibility, the generic
`audit append --field Timestamp=...` form is still accepted, but its value is
intentionally ignored. Historical shards are not rewritten: readers that parse
whole files must split on `---` and use the first timestamp in each block, or
deduplicate timestamp fields produced by older versions.

## Event Registry (86 events, 22 categories)

### Workflow Lifecycle (4 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| ✓ `WORKFLOW_STARTED` | Scope determined, workflow begins | Timestamp, Scope, Request | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create` |
| ✓ `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED` | All in-scope stages done | Timestamp, Scope, Details | `tools/aidlc-state.ts complete-workflow` |
| ✓ `WORKFLOW_PARKED` | Workflow parked mid-flow for a later session (no stage advanced) | Timestamp, Stage | `tools/aidlc-state.ts park` |
| ✓ `WORKFLOW_UNPARKED` | Park marker cleared on explicit `--resume` re-entry | Timestamp | `tools/aidlc-state.ts unpark` |

### Phase Lifecycle (4 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| ✓ `PHASE_STARTED` | Phase begins (first in-scope stage about to run) | Timestamp, Phase, Stage count, Scope | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create` (Init phase), `tools/aidlc-state.ts advance` (phase boundary) |
| ✓ `PHASE_COMPLETED` | Crossed a phase boundary | Timestamp, From phase, To phase, Stages completed | `tools/aidlc-state.ts advance`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts complete-workflow` |
| `PHASE_VERIFIED` | Traceability check at boundary | Timestamp, Phase boundary, Pass/fail, Issues | `tools/aidlc-state.ts advance`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts complete-workflow` |
| `PHASE_SKIPPED` | Scope excludes phase | Timestamp, Phase, Scope, Reason | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create` (per-phase scope eval) |

### Stage Lifecycle (6 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| ✓ `STAGE_STARTED` | Stage enters `[-]` Active | Timestamp, Stage, Agent | `tools/aidlc-state.ts advance`, `tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create` (init stages) |
| `STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL` | Stage enters `[?]` (gate open) | Timestamp, Stage, Artifacts, optional `Recovered=true` (backfilled gate row) | `tools/aidlc-state.ts gate-start` (organic, or `--recovered` backfill), `tools/aidlc-state.ts revise` (gate re-entry), `tools/aidlc-state.ts approve` (backstop re-entry after its opening guards pass) |
| `STAGE_REVISING` | Stage enters `[R]` (user rejected gate) | Timestamp, Stage, Revision count, Feedback, optional `Recovered=true` (backfilled by the approve-time revision backstop) | `tools/aidlc-state.ts reject`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts approve` (backstop backfill) |
| ✓ `STAGE_COMPLETED` | Stage finishes (`[x]`) | Timestamp, Stage, Details, Artifacts | `tools/aidlc-state.ts approve` (gated stages; also auto-advances to next), `tools/aidlc-state.ts advance` (non-gated stages), `tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create` (init stages) |
| `STAGE_JUMPED` | Forward/backward/redo jump target reached | Timestamp, Direction, Source, Target, Scope | `tools/aidlc-jump.ts execute` |
| `STAGE_SKIPPED` | Current stage reports a justified skip, or a jump skips it (`[S]`) | Timestamp, Stage, Reason | `tools/aidlc-state.ts skip` (internally routed by `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --result skipped`), `tools/aidlc-jump.ts execute` |

### Session Events (5 events — hook-owned, independent of workflow lifecycle)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `SESSION_STARTED` | Fresh Claude Code session begins (source=startup or clear) | Timestamp, Source | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` |
| `SESSION_RESUMED` | Existing Claude Code session resumed (source=resume) | Timestamp, Source | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` |
| `SESSION_COMPACTED` | Context compaction occurred | Timestamp, Current Stage, State Validity | `hooks/aidlc-validate-state.ts` (PreCompact) |
| `SESSION_ENDED` | Claude Code session terminates | Timestamp, Reason | `hooks/aidlc-session-end.ts` |
| `HUMAN_TURN` | A supported prompt-submit or answered-widget seam was observed (the approval/interview gate requires one since the last gate resolution) | Timestamp | `hooks/aidlc-record-human-turn.ts` (UserPromptSubmit + PostToolUse AskUserQuestion) + the per-harness prompt-submit adapters |

`HUMAN_TURN` is chronological presence evidence, not authenticated decision
content. The `--user-input`, `--feedback`, and `--details` fields recorded by
authority-bearing tools are caller-supplied prose. A narrow defense-in-depth
tripwire rejects recognized explicit conductor/model self-attribution, but
unlabelled, paraphrased, localized, or otherwise unrecognized wording remains
indistinguishable from human-authored text. `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1`
also disables that tripwire for deterministic recovery/tests. Audit shards are
operational evidence, not a tamper-proof human-authorship boundary.

### Initialization Events (3 events — fire IN ADDITION TO `STAGE_COMPLETED`)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `WORKSPACE_SCAFFOLDED` | Directory tree created | Timestamp, Details | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` handleInit |
| `WORKSPACE_SCANNED` | Workspace detection done | Timestamp, Project type, Details | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` handleInit |
| `WORKSPACE_INITIALISED` | State file created | Timestamp, Details | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` handleInit |

### Navigation Events (7 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `SCOPE_CHANGED` | `--scope` changed existing scope | Timestamp, Old scope, New scope | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `PLUGIN_SELECTION_CHANGED` | `select-plugins` changed enabled plugins | Timestamp, Previous Selection, New Selection | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts select-plugins` |
| `DEPTH_CHANGED` | `--depth` changed depth level | Timestamp, Old depth, New depth | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `TEST_STRATEGY_CHANGED` | `--test-strategy` changed test strategy | Timestamp, Old strategy, New strategy | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `REVIEW_CLASS_CHANGED` | `--review` changed the per-run review override | Timestamp, Old Override, New Override | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `SCOPE_DETECTED` | Auto-detected from freeform text | Timestamp, Detected scope, Input text, Source, Matched keywords (optional; present when `Source=keyword`) | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts detect-scope` |
| `RECOMPOSED` | The adaptive composer re-shaped a running workflow's pending stages (suffix flips via `recompose`) | Timestamp, Scope, Stages skipped, Stages added, Stages in Scope | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts recompose` |

### Interaction Events (8 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `DECISION_RECORDED` | Before presenting a non-gate structured question, to record the options shown. Consolidated-summary prompts also carry checkpoint identity | Timestamp, Stage, Decision, Options; optional Checkpoint, Questions File, Unit, Workflow | `tools/aidlc-log.ts decision` |
| `GATE_APPROVED` | Human approved at gate | Timestamp, Stage, User Input | `tools/aidlc-state.ts approve` |
| `GATE_REJECTED` | Human requested changes | Timestamp, Stage, Feedback, optional `Recovered=true` (backfilled by the approve-time revision backstop) | `tools/aidlc-state.ts reject`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts approve` (backstop backfill) |
| `QUESTION_ANSWERED` | Non-gate question answered by user | Timestamp, Stage, Details | `tools/aidlc-log.ts answer` |
| `SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_RECORDED` | Consolidated-summary choice recorded after the matching prompt and a fresh human turn; reserved from the public audit CLI | Timestamp, Stage, Details, Checkpoint, Questions File, Questions SHA-256; optional Unit, Workflow | `tools/aidlc-log.ts answer --checkpoint summary-confirmation` |
| `REVIEW_REQUESTED` | Conductor dispatches the §12a reviewer sub-agent; reserved from the public audit CLI | Timestamp, Stage, Reviewer, Iteration, Artifact Fingerprint (`sha256:<hex>` over the bytes dispatched for review), optional Unit (authoritative-DAG per-unit stages), optional Retry (`pending-request` recovery of an unmatched request), optional Recovery (`stale-receipt` bounded recovery after artifact/source invalidation) | `tools/aidlc-log.ts review` |
| `REVIEW_COMPLETED` | Reviewer verdict read; gates the approval of a reviewer-bearing stage, must pair to the same request iteration and unchanged request fingerprint, and is reserved from the public audit CLI | Timestamp, Stage, Reviewer, Iteration, Verdict, Artifact Fingerprint (must match the request and current bytes), optional Unit (per-unit stages), optional Source Fingerprint (`workspace_requires` stages only: git-native source hash or `unbindable`; modern unbindable receipts fail closed) | `tools/aidlc-log.ts review --verdict` |
| `PIPELINE_LINK_COMPLETED` | A declared pipeline link returned in order; current-attempt receipts gate pipeline approval and are reserved from the public audit CLI | Timestamp, Stage, Link, Position (`k/N`), optional Repo (required by the protocol for multi-repo chains), optional Workflow (`single-stage:<slug>` for isolated runs) | `tools/aidlc-log.ts link` |

### Unit Lifecycle Events (4 events — inline per-unit Construction stages)

The interactive twin of the swarm's `SWARM_UNIT_*` ledger. `UNIT_COMPLETED` is
the completion receipt the engine's coverage walk prefers over bare artifact
existence once any receipt exists for the stage; the emitting verb verifies
the unit's required artifacts as regular files on disk before committing it.
`Run floor` is an exact boundary token (`<event>:<timestamp>#<ordinal>`), so
same-second attempts within one shard cannot reuse receipts. Equal-time
boundaries in different shards are causally unordered and use a deterministic
`AMBIGUOUS:<timestamp>#<digest>` floor; prior receipts cannot match it.
Unit-major stages key the floor to workflow/jump/rejection boundaries because
their work can precede their own `STAGE_STARTED`.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `UNIT_STARTED` | A unit's work begins on an inline per-unit stage; refused while another unit of the stage is open | Timestamp, Stage, Unit, Run floor | `tools/aidlc-state.ts unit start` |
| `UNIT_PAUSED` | A unit stops before completion; the checkpoint carries why and what comes next | Timestamp, Stage, Unit, Run floor, Reason, Next Action | `tools/aidlc-state.ts unit pause` |
| `UNIT_RESUMED` | The paused unit is explicitly resumed (the engine hard-stops until this) | Timestamp, Stage, Unit, Run floor | `tools/aidlc-state.ts unit resume` |
| `UNIT_COMPLETED` | The unit's work is done AND its required artifacts are regular files on disk (verified at emit) | Timestamp, Stage, Unit, Run floor | `tools/aidlc-state.ts unit complete` |

### Artifact Events (3 events — hook-emitted)

The artifact hook emits for writes in either the active intent's record tree or
the active space's shared `codekb/<repo>/` tree.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `ARTIFACT_CREATED` | New artifact written in the active intent record or space-level codekb tree | Timestamp, Tool, File, Context | `hooks/aidlc-write-audit-log.ts` (PostToolUse; Write to net-new path) |
| `ARTIFACT_UPDATED` | Existing artifact modified in either tree | Timestamp, Tool, File, Context | `hooks/aidlc-write-audit-log.ts` (PostToolUse; Edit, or Write overwriting existing) |
| `ARTIFACT_REUSED` | Re-use decision on backward jump or per-repo pipeline reuse evidence; only `Decision=keep` grants the pipeline exemption; reserved from the public audit CLI | Timestamp, Stage, Decision, Artifacts, optional Repo | `tools/aidlc-state.ts reuse-artifact` |

### Subagent Events (1 event — hook-emitted)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` | Subagent task finishes | Timestamp, Agent Type, optional Agent ID, optional Message | `hooks/aidlc-log-subagent.ts` (SubagentStop) |

### Reviewer Enforcement Events (2 events - hook-emitted)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `REVIEWER_SCOPE_BLOCKED` | A per-unit reviewer's tool call was refused for reaching into sibling units' `construction/` paths (the §12a read-scope bound) | Timestamp, Tool, Target, Stage, Unit | `hooks/aidlc-reviewer-scope.ts` (PreToolUse) |
| `REVIEW_FREEZE_BLOCKED` | A file-tool or shell `produces[]` write was refused because it would invalidate a fresh READY review receipt before the gate (the §12a terminal-receipt ordering) | Timestamp, Tool, Target, Stage, optional Unit | `hooks/aidlc-review-freeze.ts` (PreToolUse) |

### Plan Approval Events (1 event — hook-emitted)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `PLAN_APPROVAL_BLOCKED` | A code-generation developer-agent dispatch was refused because a targeted unit lacked a non-empty, explicitly approved `code-generation-plan.md` (stage Steps 2-3 must precede Step 4) | Timestamp, Tool, Target, Stage, Unit | `hooks/aidlc-plan-approval-guard.ts` (PreToolUse) |

### Documents (3 events)

The DocumentKB is a **space-level** store, so all three events land in the space-level audit shard (`spaces/<space>/intents/audit/`) even for an intent-scoped document — the intent UUID is recorded as a field rather than selecting the shard. This keeps one document's history in one place across an `associate`/`dissociate` scope change. These events are provenance, **not a backup**: deleting the whole `documentkb/` tree destroys the per-document records, so document ids, tombstones, and intent links do NOT survive it — the next `sync` re-indexes the surviving originals as brand-new rows. Only a lost `index.json` alone is recoverable (`sync` rebuilds it from the per-document `metadata.json` files).

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `DOCUMENT_INDEXED` | A customer document was indexed into the DocumentKB for the first time (from `onboard`, and from `sync`'s fresh-document branch) | Timestamp, Space, Document, Source, Digest, optional Intent | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` |
| `DOCUMENT_UPDATED` | An indexed document's record changed — a new revision, a re-extraction, a move, or an intent association change (from `associate`, `dissociate`, `rebind`, `onboard`'s edited-row branch, `sync`'s moved/changed/retried branches, and the idempotent audit-repair pass) | Timestamp, Space, Document, Change, optional Intent | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` |
| `DOCUMENT_REMOVED` | The original is gone; the row became a metadata-only tombstone and extracted content was deleted (from `sync`) | Timestamp, Space, Document, Last Path, Last Digest | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` |

All three are written to the **space-level** shard (`intents/audit/`), not an intent's,
even when the document carries `related_intent_ids`. A document outlives any single
intent and `associate`/`dissociate` can move its scope, so filing its provenance under
the active intent would split one document's history across shards. An
`associate`/`dissociate` that changes nothing emits **no** event: a per-call event
would fill the ledger with non-changes and break reconstruction-from-the-ledger.

### Utility Events (1 event)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `HEALTH_CHECKED` | `--doctor` completed | Timestamp, Request, Details | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts handleDoctor` |

### Error/Recovery Events (2 events)

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `ERROR_LOGGED` | Tool CLI exited non-zero via `error()` | Timestamp, Tool, Command, Error | `tools/aidlc-lib.ts emitError` (called by every tool's `error()` helper) |
| `RECOVERY_COMPLETED` | User answered the compaction-awareness prompt | Timestamp, Choice, Current Stage | `tools/aidlc-state.ts acknowledge-compaction` |

### Construction Bolt Events (4 events)

Emitted only during Phase 3 (Construction). A Bolt is one execution of stages 3.1–3.5 for a Unit or small group of dependency-linked Units. See `stage-protocol.md` Glossary.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `BOLT_STARTED` | Orchestrator begins a Bolt (or parallel batch of Bolts) | Timestamp, Bolt names, Batch number, Walking skeleton (true/false), optional Bolt slug (when --worktree) | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts start` |
| `BOLT_COMPLETED` | All Bolts in the batch finished successfully | Timestamp, Bolt names, Batch number, optional Bolt slug (when --merge) | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts complete` |
| `BOLT_FAILED` | A Bolt failed during code-generation, or was explicitly aborted by the user | Timestamp, Failed Bolt, Error summary, optional Bolt slug (halt-and-ask correlation surface read by `aidlc-worktree info --slug`), optional Reason (`aborted` for explicit abort), optional Succeeded siblings | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts fail` and `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts abort` |
| `AUTONOMY_MODE_SET` | User answered the ladder prompt after the walking skeleton | Timestamp, Mode (`autonomous` or `gated`) | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts set-autonomy` |

### Worktree (7 events)

Emitted during Phase 3 (Construction) when Bolts run inside per-Bolt git worktrees. Worktree primitive emits `WORKTREE_*`; state fork/merge subcommands emit `STATE_*`; audit fork/merge subcommands emit `AUDIT_*`.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `WORKTREE_CREATED` | Per-Bolt git worktree created from main on Bolt start | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Worktree path, Branch name, Base branch | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` (`create`) |
| `WORKTREE_MERGED` | Bolt's worktree merged back to main on gate approval | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Worktree path, Target branch, Strategy | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` (`merge`) |
| `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` | Aborted Bolt's worktree explicitly removed | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Worktree path, Reason | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` (`discard`) |
| `STATE_FORKED` | State file forked to worktree on Bolt start | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Worktree path, Source state hash, Target state hash | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (`fork`) |
| `STATE_MERGED` | Worktree's state merged back to main state on gate approval | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Worktree path, Source state hash, Target state hash, Conflict resolution | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (`merge`) |
| `AUDIT_FORKED` | Audit log forked to worktree on Bolt start (audit-of-intent — emit precedes the byte-copy) | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Source Audit Hash, Fork Boundary | `tools/aidlc-audit.ts` (`audit-fork`) |
| `AUDIT_MERGED` | Worktree's audit entries appended to main audit on gate approval; per-Bolt entry order preserved, cross-Bolt order reflects merge-completion order | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Entries Merged, Source Audit Hash, Fork Boundary, Fork Timestamp | `tools/aidlc-audit.ts` (`audit-merge`) |

### Practices (4 events)

Emitted by the Inception stage `practices-discovery` and by the Construction orchestrator at runtime. The stage emits at the affirmation gate; the orchestrator emits at runtime via `--type empty` (fallback advisory) and `--type override` (discriminator-field for the bolt-plan-marker-conflict path).

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `PRACTICES_DISCOVERED` | Greenfield or brownfield lead draft, three support contributions, human interview, and lead integration completed; drafts await affirmation | Timestamp, sources scanned, drafts produced | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type discovered` |
| `PRACTICES_AFFIRMED` | Team approved practices at the practices-discovery affirmation gate; content promoted to `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` and `project.md` | Timestamp, affirming user, sections written, mandated/forbidden rules appended | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-promote` |
| `PRACTICES_OVERRIDE` | Cross-row promotion failed during practices-discovery affirmation, OR walking-skeleton stance from active-space `team.md` overrode bolt-plan's marker for the current Bolt | Timestamp, Reason (discriminator); per-path field set: write-failure path emits Reason + Failure detail only (no Bolt fields); bolt-plan-marker-conflict path emits Reason + Bolt slug + Practices Stance + Bolt-Plan Marker. The two field sets do not overlap, so doctor filters by `Reason` and routes by either name family — `write-failure-*` for the affirmation promotion path, `bolt-plan-marker-conflict` for the orchestrator runtime path | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-promote` (write-failure path); `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type override` (bolt-plan-marker-conflict path — discriminator-field disambiguation, no separate event) |
| `PRACTICES_SECTION_EMPTY` | Orchestrator read a practices section that returned empty; falling back to org defaults (advisory-only) | Timestamp, Section name, Fallback source | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type empty` |

### Merge Dispatch (3 events)

Emitted when Construction's Bolt-merge step calls aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent via Task to determine the merge strategy from team practices prose. Emitted via the `aidlc-bolt dispatch-event` subcommand. The orchestrator brackets each aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent dispatch — pre-call INVOKED, post-call RETURNED on successful parse, FALLBACK on timeout/malformed-YAML. Audit-of-intent semantic: INVOKED emits before the LLM Task call (no disk side-effect for the dispatch itself; reconciliation by slug + timestamp window). Doctor reconciles orphan INVOKED rows.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED` | Orchestrator dispatched aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent with current practices section + Bolt context | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Practices section excerpt | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED` |
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` | Agent returned parsed YAML with strategy, target branch, confidence, notes | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Strategy, Target branch, Confidence, Notes | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` |
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` | Agent timed out or returned malformed YAML; orchestrator fell back to org defaults — critical observability hook | Timestamp, Bolt slug, Fallback reason, Defaults applied | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` |

### Sensor Events (5 events)

Emitted by the deterministic-sensor system. The sensor dispatcher emits the four `SENSOR_*` events; the paired-coverage doctor row emits `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` with `Scope: all`, because doctor reads the full resolved guardrail set without an active stage (the per-workflow org → project → phase → stage scoping in the When-clause below describes the steady-state loader, not doctor's unscoped read). Coverage is environmental — every Inception/Construction/Operation stage that writes markdown emits at least one `SENSOR_FIRED` row from the registry-default sensors (`upstream-coverage`, `required-sections`); Construction/Operation TS/JS writes additionally emit `linter` and `type-check` rows. Advisory-only; the future ralph driver introduces blocking semantics for Construction-phase sensors.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `SENSOR_FIRED` | Dispatcher invoked a sensor against a stage output (per PostToolUse Write/Edit match on the sensor's `matches` filter) | Timestamp, Fire id, Sensor ID, Stage slug, Output path | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` |
| `SENSOR_PASSED` | Sensor completed and reported no findings (also: tool-unavailable, script-error fall-through — see Note footnote) | Timestamp, Fire id, Sensor ID, Stage slug, Output path, Duration ms | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` |
| `SENSOR_FAILED` | Sensor completed and reported findings; detail file written at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/<stage-slug>/<sensor-id>-<fire-id>.md` | Timestamp, Fire id, Sensor ID, Stage slug, Output path, Detail path, Findings count | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` |
| `SENSOR_BUDGET_OVERRIDE` | Sensor exceeded its configured cap (registry / binding / depth-derived per the three-layer cap model) and was terminated or skipped | Timestamp, Fire id, Sensor ID, Stage slug, Output path, Cap layer, Cap value, Observed value | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` |
| `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` | Guardrail loader resolved the scope-hierarchical guardrail set for the active workflow (org → project → phase → stage); doctor's paired-coverage check reads from this event | Timestamp, Scope, Path, Rule count | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |

> The `Note` field on `SENSOR_PASSED` is optional. It carries `tool-unavailable` when the per-sensor script's underlying binary isn't on PATH (advisory PASS, not failure), or `script-error: <reason>` for spawn-failure / non-zero exit / malformed JSON / detail-write failure paths. Pair correlation is via `Fire id` (echoed verbatim from `SENSOR_FIRED` to the terminal row); `Output path` alone does not disambiguate when the PostToolUse Write/Edit hook fires the same sensor + stage + path tuple multiple times within a stage.

> **Pair by `Fire id`, not by audit-row index.** The PostToolUse Write/Edit hook can fan out a single tool call to four parallel sensor fires (one per applicable sensor on the matching stage). Terminal rows interleave by spawn duration — a 200ms linter beats a 4s tsc — so `findAllEvents("SENSOR_FIRED")[i]` does NOT pair with `findAllEvents("SENSOR_PASSED")[i]` by index. Audit-walking consumers (the `sensor_firings[]` populator, doctor, designer) MUST match terminal rows to FIRED rows via the 8-hex `Fire id` correlator. The dispatcher emits `Fire id` on every row precisely so this pairing remains O(1) under arbitrary fan-out + interleave.

### Learning Loop (3 events)

Emitted by stage-protocol §13 (Learnings Ritual). The runtime-graph compile emits `MEMORY_EMPTY` when a just-approved stage's memory.md has zero non-blank entries under the four standard headings. The learning-gate tool emits `RULE_LEARNED` when the user keeps a surfaced or free-text learning (a learning IS a practice — it lands as a practice line under the routed heading in `{project,team}.md`) and `SENSOR_PROPOSED` when a learning installs a sensor binding (manifest + originating stage `sensors:` frontmatter). Doctor reads `MEMORY_EMPTY` rows over time to detect systematic diary-skipping across stages.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `MEMORY_EMPTY` | A stage approval triggered a runtime-graph compile and the stage's memory.md had zero non-blank entries under any of the four §13 headings | Timestamp, Stage | `tools/aidlc-runtime.ts compile` |
| `RULE_LEARNED` | The learning gate persisted a kept learning as a practice line under the routed heading in `{project,team}.md` | Timestamp, Stage, Candidate-ID, Content-Hash, Destination, Heading, Source | `tools/aidlc-learnings.ts persist` |
| `SENSOR_PROPOSED` | The learning gate scaffolded a project-tier sensor manifest and bound it to the originating stage's `sensors:` frontmatter | Timestamp, Stage, Candidate-ID, Sensor ID, Manifest path, Matches, Destinations, Source | `tools/aidlc-learnings.ts persist` |

### Swarm (6 events)

All six swarm events emit from the swarm referee `aidlc-swarm.ts` — the deterministic verdict surface the conductor consults. The referee is stateless (no iteration counter): `prepare` captures the exact stage-attempt token, forks the per-unit worktrees, and emits stamped `SWARM_STARTED` (and `SWARM_DEGRADED` when the conductor reports a loud downgrade); `finalize` requires that prepared token to still match the current attempt before merging, then preserves it on each convergence row. A worktree prepared by the immediately preceding unstamped release remains finalizable only when its frozen audit prefix proves the matching legacy `SWARM_STARTED`, `BOLT_STARTED`, `STATE_FORKED`, and `AUDIT_FORKED` sequence, the fork hash still matches, all three worktree mirrors exist, and the derived frozen attempt still equals the current attempt; this compatibility path never emits a backdated start or adopts a stale worktree. It re-verifies the conductor's claimed-converged set, serialised-merges the genuine passes, and emits the per-Unit pair (`SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` / `SWARM_UNIT_FAILED` — except a converged unit whose merge-back failed, which gets neither row until a finalize retry merges it), the per-failed-Unit baton row (`SWARM_BATON_RETURNED`), and the batch tally (`SWARM_COMPLETED`). The `check` subcommand emits nothing — it is an advisory verdict that informs the conductor's retry decision. The engine is read-only and the conductor never emits audit events, so the deterministic tool owns the whole swarm taxonomy. Because the loop and its cap live in the driver (the ultracode script's `for`-bound or the subagent floor's harness ceiling), not in the referee, the per-Unit rows carry no `Iterations` / `Cap value` fields — there is no counter to record.

| Event | When | Required Fields | Emitter |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `SWARM_STARTED` | Swarm referee `prepare` captured the exact attempt and forked a batch of dependency-linked Units | Timestamp, Batch number, Unit names, Concurrency cap, Stage, Run floor | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |
| `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` | A swarm Unit re-verified green (and untampered) at the `finalize` gate AND its AIDLC metadata merge-back landed (a converged unit in `merge_failures` gets no row until a finalize retry merges it) | Timestamp, Batch number, Unit name, Stage, Run floor (the exact token captured by `SWARM_STARTED`; consumers require an exact current-attempt match), optional Source Fingerprint and Source Commit (immutable reviewed source accepted by `aidlc-worktree merge`), or `Source Freshness Bypass: true` when finalize explicitly used `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` (merge must repeat the switch) | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |
| `SWARM_UNIT_FAILED` | A swarm Unit failed the `finalize` re-verify (not claimed, claimed-but-red, or tampered) | Timestamp, Batch number, Unit name, Reason | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |
<!-- Reason for a CLAIMED-but-red / tampered unit is always the tool's own verdict (`error`); for a DECLINED (unclaimed) unit it is the conductor's typed attribution via `finalize --reasons` (`unsatisfiable` / `budget-exhausted` / `cap-exhausted`, defaulting to `cap-exhausted`) — the tool records the conductor's knowledge call, it does not judge unsatisfiability itself (D-I). -->
| `SWARM_BATON_RETURNED` | A swarm Unit returned the baton to the conductor for orchestrator-mediated coordination | Timestamp, Batch number, Unit name, Reason | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |
| `SWARM_COMPLETED` | All Units in the batch finished (converged or failed); batch closed | Timestamp, Batch number, Converged count, Failed count | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |
| `SWARM_DEGRADED` | `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` was requested but the Workflow tool was unavailable, so the conductor ran the subagent floor (loud-degrade) | Timestamp, Batch number, Requested driver, Fallback driver | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` |

## Hook-Generated Format

Hooks emit events through the same library emitter as orchestrator-driven emissions (`appendAuditEntry` from `tools/aidlc-audit.ts`). Hook-emitted events are first-class taxonomy members (`ARTIFACT_CREATED`, `ARTIFACT_UPDATED`, `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED`, all `SESSION_*`) — there is no longer a separate "free-form hook entry" format. A hook with no active workflow in `cwd` is a no-op; session events only append to a workflow's audit.md when one exists.

The public `aidlc-audit.ts append` CLI is a diagnostic escape hatch, not the canonical emit path: it refuses authority-bearing receipts (`HUMAN_TURN`, `GATE_APPROVED`, `GATE_REJECTED`, `QUESTION_ANSWERED`, `REVIEW_REQUESTED`, `REVIEW_COMPLETED`, `PIPELINE_LINK_COMPLETED`, `ARTIFACT_REUSED`, `SWARM_STARTED`, `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED`, `AUTONOMY_MODE_SET`, `UNIT_STARTED`, `UNIT_PAUSED`, `UNIT_RESUMED`, `UNIT_COMPLETED`), which only their owning tool or hook may emit. Field names must be printable single-line labels matching the audit field grammar; values have every line terminator escaped. `append-raw` likewise refuses a body carrying an `**Event**:` line naming a taxonomy event and refuses line-breaking headings.

## Format Standards

- All timestamps: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Generate fresh timestamp for EACH entry via `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` (tools do this automatically)
- Append-only — NEVER modify or delete existing entries
- No sensitive data (credentials, PII, secrets)
- Human decisions recorded verbatim — NEVER summarize
