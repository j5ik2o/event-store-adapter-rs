// Learning-gate tool — the tool-as-actor half of stage-protocol §13's
// Learnings Ritual. Two subcommands:
//
//   surface --slug <stage-slug> [--project-dir <path>]
//       Read-only. Reads the just-approved stage's memory.md (via
//       parseMemoryEntries), partitions entries into keep-candidates
//       (Interpretations / Deviations / Tradeoffs) and parked open
//       questions, and emits a structured JSON candidate set on stdout.
//       Carries NO AskUserQuestion field names — the orchestrator renders
//       the AUQ, runs the single-line admission conflict-check (KNOWLEDGE),
//       and the user decides keep/heading/scope (JUDGEMENT).
//       ALSO binds the space + intent active AT SURFACE TIME into the
//       output (LOCAL FIX, #735 follow-up / PR #747 review) — see
//       "Provenance binding" below.
//
//   persist --slug <stage-slug> --selections-json <path> [--project-dir <path>]
//       The deterministic WRITER. Reads the post-AUQ selections-json
//       (conflict-clear / user-escalated only — persist never judges),
//       and inside ONE withAuditLock body (decide-inside-lock): re-reads
//       the audit fresh, dedups per (Stage, Content-Hash) against the
//       fresh audit + an in-memory cid-marker content-presence check,
//       writes a confirmed learning as a PRACTICE under the orchestrator-
//       routed heading in {project,team}.md (the relocated method files the
//       resolver reads — a learning IS a practice, vision §6; the heading is
//       ensure-exists so an absent target is created, never a throw), or
//       scaffolds + two-write-binds a project-tier sensor manifest, then
//       emits RULE_LEARNED / SENSOR_PROPOSED.
//
// --- Provenance binding + content-addressed dedup (#735 follow-up, PR #747
//     review) ---
// Twelve findings from PR #747's five review rounds, fixed here:
//   1. Candidate ids restart at c1 on EVERY surface() call, so a later run
//      of the same stage in the SAME intent reused c1 for a completely
//      different learning and the old (intent, stage, candidate-id) marker
//      treated it as an idempotent retry, silently dropping the write.
//      Fixed by keying the marker/audit-match on a content hash of the
//      learning's own text instead of the positional candidate id.
//   2. `persist` re-resolved the active intent live at execution time, so a
//      surface-under-A / switch-to-B / persist sequence wrote under B's
//      marker instead of A's. Fixed by binding space+intent at surface()
//      time and threading that SAME value through persist's audit read,
//      audit write, and lock identity — never re-resolved from the live
//      cursor inside persist.
//   3. The (intent, stage, candidate-id) marker/row shape this file has
//      shipped before, the original pre-#735 (stage, candidate-id) shape,
//      and the earlier PR revision's truncated content hash are recognized
//      as legacy-compatible dedup matches so a post-upgrade retry does not
//      duplicate an already-persisted learning under the full-hash marker.
//   4. Ambiguous intent resolution (multiple intent records, no valid
//      cursor) must fail closed rather than silently degrading to the same
//      shared "unscoped" identity finding #1 exists to avoid — see
//      resolveSurfaceIntent().
//   5. The lock identity and audit read/write were pinned to the
//      surface-time space (finding #2), but practiceFilePath still called
//      memoryDirFor(projectDir) with no space argument — falling back to
//      whatever space happened to be LIVE-active when persist ran, not the
//      one the selection was surfaced under. Fixed by threading the pinned
//      space through practiceFilePath into memoryDirFor.
//   6. The sensor branch's own dedup (priorSensorProposedRow, formerly
//      priorAuditRow) still keyed on (stage, candidate_id) — the same
//      unstable-key defect class finding #1 fixed for learnings, recurring
//      for sensors: a later surface() run proposing the SAME sensor id
//      under a different candidate id re-emitted a duplicate
//      SENSOR_PROPOSED. Fixed by keying on (stage, the sensor's own stable
//      manifest id) instead of (stage, candidate_id) — stage stays in the
//      key because binding is legitimately per-stage even though the
//      manifest itself is a per-project singleton; dropping stage entirely
//      would make the no-op branch global and block a second, unrelated
//      stage from ever binding a sensor another stage had already proposed.
//   7. A legacy-marker match (finding #3) was recognized by candidate_id
//      alone, so a genuinely DIFFERENT learning landing on the same
//      positional candidate_id post-upgrade was mistaken for a retry of the
//      original and silently dropped — "two different learnings landing on
//      the same positional candidate id never collide" does not hold across
//      the upgrade boundary. Fixed by gating a legacy match on the marked
//      line's own text equalling the current selection's text
//      (legacyLineMatchesText).
//   8. `intent: null` is a real surface-time provenance value, but persist
//      converted it to `undefined`, whose audit-path meaning is "resolve the
//      live/lone intent." If an intent was born between surface and replay,
//      the unscoped learning was therefore audited under that later intent.
//      Fixed by failing closed inside the lock when an unscoped selections
//      file is replayed after any intent record appears; the user must
//      re-run surface and regenerate the selections file.
//   9. Truncating SHA-256 to 8 hex characters made collisions practical for
//      a persisted correctness identity, silently dropping different text.
//      Fixed by retaining the full digest.
//  10. The audit snapshot is intentionally read once inside the lock, but
//      rows emitted earlier in the same selections batch were not reflected
//      in it. Fixed by tracking hashes emitted during the transaction.
//  11. Provenance validation checked only path-safe syntax, so a valid-looking
//      missing space or intent could create a partial record. Fixed by
//      requiring the pinned records to still exist inside the lock.
//  12. A caller-provided --slug could override selections.stage_slug and
//      misattribute the marker and audit row. Fixed by rejecting a mismatch.
//
// The conflict COMPARISON is the orchestrator-LLM's job (the "single-line
// variant" of the §5 gate model); persist receives only conflict-clear or
// user-escalated selections and never judges. See docs/reference/
// 07-sensor-system.md "Gate-ritual handoff" for the round-trip.
//
// Three-concerns split (explainer §6:712): detection + surfacing +
// routing + writing are deterministic (this tool); the conflict-check
// comparison is knowledge (orchestrator-LLM); revise/skip/escalate is
// judgement (user). No LLM call lives in this tool.
