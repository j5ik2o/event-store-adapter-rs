// aidlc-knowledge.ts — the DocumentKB tool: index a customer's documents into a
// committed, searchable catalog.
//
// Two directories, and the split between them is load-bearing:
//   knowledge/documents/    USER-managed originals. Their folder structure is
//                           theirs — nested by topic, by customer, however they
//                           like — and this tool NEVER reorganises it.
//   knowledge/documentkb/   TOOL-managed, derived, and safe to rebuild from
//                           documents/ at any time.
//
// That gives the invariant the whole design rests on: documentkb/ is
// RECONSTRUCTIBLE. Delete index.json and `sync` rebuilds it from documents/ plus
// each surviving document's own metadata.json. Nothing unrecoverable lives only
// in documentkb/.
//
// NOT from the audit ledger, which an earlier draft of this comment claimed:
// rebuildIndex() reads the filesystem only, and the sole audit call in this file
// is the WRITE side. The distinction matters for what a reader expects to
// survive -- deleting a per-document metadata.json really does lose that row's
// tombstone, and no ledger replay brings it back.
//
// Every write goes through the journaled transaction: take the workspace lock,
// stage outside it, re-validate the source digest inside it, then `rename()` the
// finished tree in as the single commit point. An earlier draft of this comment
// said `onboard` "writes directly, which is why it is not yet safe under
// concurrency" — true when it was written, stale since the transaction landed.
//
// THE READ BOUNDARY. Every path this tool touches came from somewhere it does
// not control — a CLI argument, a directory walk, or a committed index row — so
// four shared guards apply, and none is optional:
//   0. THE ANCHOR ITSELF is trusted first (assertKnowledgeRootTrusted): no
//      container on the way down to documentkb/ may be a symlink;
//   1. the shape is validated (aidlc-documentkb-schema.ts): relative, POSIX,
//      no `..`, no NUL, real digests;
//   2. no path COMPONENT is a symlink (assertNoSymlinkInChainOrThrow) — a walk
//      that validates a container and then trusts its contents will read a
//      symlinked file inside an already-trusted directory;
//   3. containment is re-checked AFTER realpathSync, and the bytes are read
//      through readRegularFileNoFollowOrThrow so the identity checked is the
//      identity read.
//
// Steps 2 and 3 are separate on purpose. A containment check on the resolved
// leaf answers "does this land inside?" but not "did we travel through
// something that can be repointed later".
//
// Step 0 was MISSING until 2026-08-08, and its absence made steps 1-3 decorative
// on the write path: they all protect paths BELOW an anchor that was itself
// resolved with realpathSync and then trusted. A symlink AT `documentkb/` was
// therefore obeyed, and a measured `onboard` wrote the whole catalog outside the
// project (and, pointed inward, into the user's own documents/). Guarding the
// contents of a container you have not verified is guarding the wrong thing.

 * The SPACE-level audit shard: `spaces/<space>/intents/audit/<host>-<clone>.md`.

 * lone intent. The space shard is only reached when `recordDir` returns null,

 * looks correct and the same call starts filing into `intents/<slug>/audit/` the
 * moment any intent exists.

 * MUST NOT land in an intent's shard: a document outlives any intent, and

 * history across shards and make it unreconstructible.

 * for it), so this composes the same path the null branch of `auditFilePath`

/**
 * THE WRITE-SIDE FUNNEL for every mutable path under `documentkb/`.

 * `assertKnowledgeRootTrusted` anchors the chain down to `documentkb/` ITSELF,
 * but a container can be trusted while what's INSIDE it is not: `.journal` or a
 * document id directory can independently be a symlink, planted after
 * `documentkb/` was created honestly. Measured against the shipped tool
 * (2026-08-11):
 *
 *   documentkb/.journal -> /outside     `collectStaleJournals` (called from
 *                                        both `sync` and standalone) `rmSync`ed
 *                                        an external victim file THROUGH the
 *                                        link, exit 0, "Up to date."
 *   documentkb/<id> -> knowledge/documents   `sync`/`associate`/`rebind` wrote
 *                                        `content.md` and `metadata.json` into
 *                                        the user's OWN originals folder.
 *
 * So containment must be re-checked per COMPONENT of the requested descendant,
 * exactly like `resolveContainedPath` already does for a read — this is that
 * same discipline applied to the write side. `journalDir`, `journalTxnDir` and
 * `documentDir` below are the intended path-builders for every mutation under
 * `documentkb/`; today every `mkdirSync`/`rmSync`/`renameSync`/`writeFileAtomic`/
 * `writeBufferAtomic` target below `documentkb/` is `join()`'d off one of their
 * return values (or off the bare, unextended `documentkbDir()`/`indexPath()`
 * anchor). That is a fact about the CURRENT body of this file, not a property
 * this function enforces — nothing here stops a future export from calling an
 * fs primitive directly against a hand-built path under a different name.
 * `documentDir`, `journalDir` and `journalTxnDir` are convenient, not
 * mandatory: a rename defeats "convenient" every time. What actually catches a
 * new unguarded call site is
 * `tests/unit/t289-knowledge-onboard-boundary.test.ts`'s pinned COUNT of raw fs-
 * mutation calls plus a per-call-site provenance trace back to the funnel or
 * the bare anchor — routed around the parameter/name a call happens to use,

 * THE TRUST ANCHOR. Refuse to operate at all if any container directory on the

 *
 * Every OTHER guard in this file protects a path BELOW an anchor it has already
 * resolved with `realpathSync` -- which silently trusts whatever that anchor
 * turned out to be. So the anchor itself was the one unguarded link in the chain,
 * and the consequences were measured, not theorised (2026-08-08, whole-slice
 * review, against the shipped tool):
 *
 *   documentkb -> /tmp/elsewhere    `onboard` wrote index.json, metadata.json,
 *                                   content.md and source.sha256 OUTSIDE the
 *                                   project. Exit 0, no warning.
 *   documentkb -> documents         the derived catalog landed INSIDE the user's
 *                                   own documents/ folder -- the exact directory
 *                                   this tool promises never to reorganise.
 *
 * Anyone who can drop a symlink at `knowledge/` or `knowledge/documentkb/` -- a
 * hostile branch, a tarball, a careless `ln -s` -- therefore chose where every
 * subsequent write landed. That is an arbitrary-file-write primitive over a
 * customer's repository, so this is a REFUSAL and never a repair: silently
 * replacing the link would destroy whatever it pointed at.
 *
 * Called from every command handler AND from inside each exported entry point
 * (`onboard`, `syncDocuments`, `listDocuments`, `showDocument`,
 * `setIntentAssociation`, `rebindDocument`). Both, deliberately: the handler call
 * fails early, before `--intent` resolution does any work, and the in-function
 * call is what protects a caller who imports the module and skips `main()`
 * entirely. Review measured that bypass -- an in-process `onboard()` against a
 * redirected `documentkb` wrote the catalog off-project with the handler guard in
 * place -- and while no in-repo caller does that today, these signatures take a
 * plain `(projectDir, space)` and give a future importer no hint that anchoring
 * is required. Cheap (a handful of `lstat`s) and idempotent, so paying for it
 * twice per invocation costs nothing worth measuring.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated rather than implied: this catches a symlink that is present when
 * the command starts. It is not a defence against a race -- an attacker who can
 * plant a symlink DURING the run, between this check and a later write, wins, and
 * closing that would mean re-anchoring after every intermediate mkdir and rename
 * inside the transaction. That residual risk is accepted: it requires a process
 * already co-resident on the filesystem and timing a several-hundred-millisecond
 * window, which is a far stronger position than the threat actually defended
 * here -- a hostile branch, tarball, or clone that lands a symlink before anyone
 * runs anything.
 *
 * Absent directories are FINE: a first run legitimately has neither `knowledge/`
 * nor `documentkb/` yet, and a path component that does not exist cannot redirect
 * anything. `assertNoSymlinkInChainOrThrow` already treats ENOENT that way.

//
//   related_intent_ids is OMITTED for a space-wide document. An EMPTY LIST IS
//   INVALID -- it is ambiguous between "space-wide" and "scoped to nothing", and
//   those are different. The schema enforces it on read; this code must never
//   produce one.
//
//   PERSISTENCE IS ALWAYS A UUID. A slug is only ever input: it is a display
//   name that can be renamed or reused, so a persisted slug would silently
//   re-point a document's scope the day someone renames an intent.
