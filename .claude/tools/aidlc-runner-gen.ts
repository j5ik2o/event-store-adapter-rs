// The runner-skill generator — one tool, two runner families.
//
// (1) STAGE-RUNNERS: one thin `skills/aidlc-<stage>/SKILL.md`
//     per RUNNABLE compiled stage slug. A stage-runner is OPT-IN SUGAR: it
//     packages `/aidlc --stage <slug> --single`, which works without it, into a
//     typeable `/aidlc-<stage>` command. The authoritative authoring path is
//     "write a stage file"; this generator bakes a runner shell over the
//     compiled graph so the set of runners can never drift from the set of
//     stages by hand. The bootstrap INITIALIZATION stages are excluded (they
//     have no standalone --single meaning); the whole init phase is packaged as
//     ONE `/aidlc-init` runner over `/aidlc --init` instead.
//     Plugin-owned stages use their bare plugin-prefixed slug as the runner
//     name; core stages keep the historical `aidlc-<stage>` name.
//
// (2) SCOPE-RUNNERS: one thin runner per shipped scope file whose frontmatter
//     declares `runner: true`. A scope-runner is packaging,
//     not definition (decision D-A): each is a ~6-line shell that drives the
//     engine (`aidlc-orchestrate next --scope <scope>`) to `done` with a fixed
//     scope and no scope detection. The full set of scopes is always reachable
//     via `/aidlc --scope <name>`; runners are typeable sugar over the
//     high-traffic ones marked in scope metadata.
//
// COMPOSE, don't reimplement. The stage-slug list comes from loadGraph() — the
// one compiled source of truth (data/stage-graph.json); the scope list comes
// from the shipped `.claude/scopes/*.md` files. A stage added to the graph (or a
// scope file dropped in) flows into a runner with no edit here, and the drift
// guards (`check` for stages — t129; `scopes --check` for scopes — t130) fail CI
// if the on-disk set ever diverges from the source-of-truth set.
//
// NO HOOKS in any runner (Fork 2→B, settled): the six skill-scoped hooks live
// project-wide in settings.json, so a runner carries no `hooks:` block to
// replicate or drift-guard — the deterministic spine is inherited, not copied.
//
// The conductor persona is delivered by the ENGINE on the first `next` (decision
// D-E, SPIKE 6) — baked into the run-stage directive — so the runner body does
// NOT load conductor.md by hand.
//
// Subcommands:
//   write            — (re)generate every STAGE-runner dir from the compiled
//                      stage list.
//   check            — STAGE-runner drift guard: exit 0 iff the on-disk runner
//                      set == the compiled stage-slug set (no missing, no
//                      orphan); exit 1 with a diff on stdout otherwise.
//   list             — print the stage slugs one per line (debugging aid).
//   scopes [--all] [--check] [--out <skills-dir>]
//                    — generate/validate SCOPE-runner skills over
//                      `.claude/scopes/*.md` (`runner: true`, or `--all`).
//
// Env seams (mirror aidlc-lib.ts): AIDLC_SCOPES_DIR points the scope-file reader
// at an isolated tree; --out points the scope writer at an isolated skills dir.

# AI-DLC Stage Runner — ${node.slug}

${bodyLead}
\`/aidlc --stage ${node.slug} --single\`; the same stage is always reachable via
that flag without this skill.

## Steps

1. Ask the engine for the single-stage directive:

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --stage ${node.slug} --single
   \`\`\`

   The engine emits one \`run-stage\` directive for \`${node.slug}\` (carrying the
   lead agent, the resolved consumes/produces paths, the rules and sensors in
   context, and — on this first directive — the conductor persona). Run the stage
   exactly as the directive describes; do not load the conductor persona by hand,
   the engine delivers it.

2. Before acting on the directive, read
   \`${harnessDir()}/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md\`. Then read every
   \`${harnessDir()}/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-<module>.md\` named by
   \`directive.protocol_modules\`. Load every listed module before reading the
   stage body or running its topology; skip only a module already loaded earlier
   in this session.

3. When the stage's work is done, commit the single-stage record:

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --single --stage ${node.slug} --result completed
   \`\`\`

   This records a STAGE_STARTED / STAGE_COMPLETED pair under a synthetic workflow
   id and stops. It NEVER writes the main workflow's \`Current Stage\` — a
   single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main
   workflow).

}

// Render the `/aidlc-init` runner: a thin wrapper over the deterministic
// `intent-create` move (which runs the whole initialization phase — mint the
// intent + detect the workspace + build state — in one call). This is the
// init-phase analogue of the per-stage runners: opt-in packaging over a path
// the engine already names at birth. It drives `intent-create`, NOT
// `--stage … --single`, so the stage-runner drift guard (which keys on the
// `--stage`+`--single` marker) never counts it. There is no user-facing
// `/aidlc --init` (P4): the workspace shell ships in dist/ and the engine
// auto-births the first intent — this runner just makes that explicit.

# AI-DLC — start a workflow (birth the first intent)

Start a fresh AI-DLC workflow. The workspace shell ships in \`dist/\` (no setup
command), and the engine auto-births the first intent when you describe what to
build — this skill is opt-in packaging over that birth move. Initialization is a
PHASE, not a single stage — it mints the intent, detects the workspace
(greenfield/brownfield), and builds \`aidlc-state.md\` together, in one
deterministic call. There is no per-init-stage runner because an init stage has
no standalone meaning.

## Steps

1. Birth the intent (run the initialization phase). Parse the user's
   \`$ARGUMENTS\`: forward any recognized flags
   (\`--scope <name>\`/\`--depth <level>\`/\`--test-strategy <level>\`)
   as-is, and pass any freeform description text via \`--arguments "<text>"\`
   (\`intent-create\` reads the description from the \`--arguments\` flag, NOT a
   positional — forwarding it bare would silently drop it). ALSO derive a short
   **\`--label\`**: a 2-3 word kebab-case essence of what's being built
   (\`"I would like to build a simple calculator application"\` → \`--label
   "simple calc"\`). The label becomes the readable, date-prefixed record dir name
   (\`<YYMMDD>-simple-calc\`); the full \`--arguments\` text is preserved separately
   in the audit + state. Omit \`--label\` only when there is no description (the
   tool then falls back to the scope token):

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create --scope <scope> --arguments "<description>" --label "<2-3 word essence>"
   \`\`\`

   Pass the user's \`--scope <name>\` when they named one; otherwise omit
   \`--scope\` — the tool resolves the implicit default itself
   (\`AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE\`, else \`classic\`). If the user gave neither a
   scope nor a description, do not run a bare \`intent-create\`: ask what they
   want to build or which scope to use. When only a scope was supplied, omit
   \`--arguments\` and \`--label\`. Print the tool's output and stop. This does
   not advance a stage; run \`/aidlc\` afterwards to continue.

# AI-DLC - compose a workflow plan

Force the adaptive composer on a task. This is packaging over
\`/aidlc compose ...\` - it does not add a second entry point; the engine
recognizes the compose request and names the composer dispatch, and the
conductor runs the same forwarding loop as \`/aidlc\`.

## Steps

1. Forward the user's \`$ARGUMENTS\` into the engine with the leading
   \`compose\` verb (pass \`--report <path>\` / \`--new-scope\` through as-is):

   \`\`\`bash
   bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next compose $ARGUMENTS
   \`\`\`

2. Act on the directive exactly as the \`aidlc\` skill's forwarding loop
   describes (the composer-dispatch print names the composer agent; render
   its proposal and hold the approve/edit/reject gate). From here the flow IS
   the \`/aidlc\` flow - continue its loop until the directive says stop.

# AI-DLC — ${scope} scope

Drive the AI-DLC engine with the **${scope}** scope fixed. This is the same
deterministic forwarding loop the \`${entrySkill}\` orchestrator runs, with \`--scope
${scope}\` baked into the first \`next\` so scope detection is skipped. The
engine owns all routing; the conductor persona arrives on the first directive's
\`conductor_persona\` field — adopt it for the whole run.

## The loop

1. \`directive = bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --scope ${scope} $ARGUMENTS\`
2. Before acting on each directive, read
   \`${harnessDir()}/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md\` once per session,
   then read every
   \`${harnessDir()}/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-<module>.md\` named by
   \`directive.protocol_modules\`. Load every listed module before acting; skip
   only a module already loaded earlier in this session. Then act on
   \`directive.kind\` exactly as the orchestrator does (run-stage / invoke-swarm /
   ask / print / error / done).
3. \`bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <directive.stage> --result <outcome> [--user-input "<text>"]\` when the directive names a stage; omit \`--stage\` only for non-stage report round-trips.
4. Repeat from step 1 until \`directive.kind == done\`.

Pass \`$ARGUMENTS\` through verbatim after \`--scope ${scope}\`; the engine parses
any flags (\`--status\`, \`--stage\`, …) and the \`--scope\` from the
state file always wins on an existing workflow, so re-running a started workflow
resumes it. To run a different scope, use \`${entrySkill} --scope <other>\` instead.

## Starting unrelated new work?

Before you forward \`$ARGUMENTS\` on step 1, make the SAME recognise-vs-route
judgment the \`${entrySkill}\` orchestrator makes: does this input **continue** the
active intent, or does it describe a **genuinely new, unrelated** piece of work?
This matters most when the active intent is already **complete**: then \`next\`
correctly returns \`done\` (the engine is read-only and never births alongside a
live intent), and the loop above would simply stop. New work is NOT a
continuation; the escape hatch is \`next --new-intent\`.

- **Default to CONTINUATION.** Treat the input as new-work ONLY when it clearly
  names a distinct feature/bug/unit unrelated to the active intent's subject
  (\`bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent --json\` gives its \`slug\` and
  \`status\`). When in doubt, continue: false-positive offers are the main risk.
- **On genuine new-work, OFFER, never auto-birth.** Surface an
  \`AskUserQuestion\` showing the active intent and the proposed new one, **including
  the scope you'd give the new intent**. Default that scope to this runner's baked
  \`${scope}\` (the new work is likely the same flavour that made the user reach for
  this command), but if the new work clearly fits a DIFFERENT scope, propose that
  instead, and name it so the human can correct it. **Lead the affirmative option
  with "Yes"** (e.g. "Yes, start a second intent"). Starting a workflow is a
  mutation gated on a human yes.
- **On CONFIRM**, re-run \`next\` with \`--new-intent\`, the confirmed scope, and the
  new-work text:

  \`\`\`bash
  bun ${harnessDir()}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts next --new-intent --scope <the confirmed scope> "<the new-work description>"
  \`\`\`

  The engine returns a \`print\` directive naming the \`intent-create\` command
  (with the \`--label "<2-3 word kebab essence>"\` placeholder). Act on it exactly
  as the loop's \`print\` handling describes: create the intent, then, because this is
  a NEW, unrelated intent and this session still carries the previous intent's
  context, **STOP** and follow the directive's hand-off: tell the user to start a
  fresh session (${freshSessionFlow}) and invoke \`${entrySkill}\` to begin the
  new intent with a clean slate. Nothing is lost; the intent is saved on disk.
- **On DECLINE**, proceed with the active intent, the normal loop above.
