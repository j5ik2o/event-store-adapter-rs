// The record (state · audit · artifacts · diary) re-roots per INTENT under a
// per-team SPACE: `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<slug>-<id8>/…`. Two cursors
// pick the active space/intent, both GITIGNORED (per-user, not shared truth):
//   - `aidlc/active-space`                            → the active space
//   - `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/active-intent`    → that space's active intent
//
// Resolution precedence (vision §5):
//   space:  explicit arg > active-space pointer > "default" (NEVER errors).
//   intent: explicit arg > active-intent pointer > lone-intent > null.
//
// NULL RESOLUTION (P9 end state — no flat root). When NO intent record resolves
// (activeIntent() → null: a fresh SEED shell before auto-birth, or a flat project
// still awaiting migration), the absolute path helpers resolve to the bare SPACE
// record root (aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/ — see spaceRecordRoot). No
// aidlc-state.md ever lives directly there, so existence-gated consumers
// (loadStateFileIfPresent) read "no workflow yet" and the orchestrator
// births/errors. The ONLY surviving flat `aidlc-docs` read is the one-time
// migration's SOURCE (flatStateSource/flatMigrationSource below).
// activeIntent() returning null IS that "no record yet" signal.

// they carry NO workflow work and never advance an intent. The orchestration
// engine's `next` already routes these to a terminal `print` directive
// (handleNext Branch 1 + 1b). They are exported HERE so a pre-LLM harness seam
// (e.g. the Kiro userPromptSubmit hook) can dispatch them deterministically off
// the SAME classification the engine uses — never a divergent hardcoded list.
//
//   - read-only utility flags: matched ANYWHERE in the args (mirrors the engine's
//     parseNextFlags, which sets `readOnly` on any matching token). Each maps to
//     its subcommand by stripping the leading `--` (--status→status, …).
//   - workspace commands: parsed ONLY when the LEADING token is a workspace
//     noun/legacy verb, so freeform prose merely containing "space"/"intent"
//     stays intent text. A leading workspace noun wins over later read-only
//     flags because those tokens belong to that command's argv.

// --- Flat-layout migration (one-time, lock-guarded, crash-safe) ---------------
//
// A pre-workspace project keeps its record at the flat `aidlc-docs/` root. This
// moves it ONCE into a per-intent record dir under spaces/default/. Two review
// blockers shaped the design (vision plan P1 migration box):
//
//  (1) DETECTION keys on a signal SEED does NOT ship: a flat `aidlc-docs/
//      aidlc-state.md` present AND no `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/*/aidlc-state.md`
//      record yet AND no `.migrated` marker. (SEED ships `aidlc/spaces/default/`,
//      so "no spaces dir" would never fire and would orphan the legacy tree.)
//  (2) IDEMPOTENCY keys on the `.migrated` marker ALONE (written LAST), never on
//      `aidlc/spaces/` existence — a crash after the parent mkdir but before the
//      move completes must re-detect and re-stage from the untouched original.
//
// MECHANISM (all inside withAuditLock on the WORKSPACE bucket): mint a UUIDv7;
// slug from existing state or "default"; (1) stage a COPY of the whole aidlc-docs/
// tree into a temp dir UNDER the workspace root (same filesystem — NOT tmpdir(),
// or a cross-device rename degrades to non-atomic); (2) mkdir the intent dir's
// PARENT chain; (3) ONE atomic rename of the staged tree into the leaf
// <slug>-<id8>/ (the leaf is created BY this rename); (4) append to intents.json
// + set active-intent; (5) write the `.migrated` marker LAST. The flat tree is
// git-rm'd post-move (the data MOVED, not deleted); the source is NEVER rmSync'd.
//
// THE ONE SURVIVING `aidlc-docs` READ. P9 removed the transitional dual-layout
// fallback — the record tree is now a SINGLE per-intent layout. The ONLY place
// the legacy flat `aidlc-docs/` root is still read is this one-time migration:

// Ledger-event presence check (the marker-free design). A real human
// is present for THIS gate-commit iff a HUMAN_TURN event appears AFTER the LAST
// GATE RESOLUTION (GATE_APPROVED / GATE_REJECTED / QUESTION_ANSWERED) in ledger
// append order. The prior resolution is the freshness boundary - this is the
// consume-once semantics expressed as event order instead of a flag.
//
// Why the boundary is the prior RESOLUTION, not this gate's STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL
// (the live Kiro IDE spike, 2026-06-30, caught this): in the real flow ONE human
// prompt drives the agent to BOTH open the gate AND approve it, so the human turn
// PRECEDES this gate-open. A "human turn after gate-open" rule false-refuses every
// legitimate approval. But a human turn after the prior gate's resolution still
// proves a fresh human acted this turn, while a fabricated cascade (gate2 approved
// right after gate1 committed, no new human turn) has its only human turn BEFORE
// the gate1 GATE_APPROVED -> refused. Stale (human turn long ago, then a fabricated
// approve) likewise has the last resolution after the human turn -> refused.
//
// Ordering is CHRONOLOGICAL (Timestamp, then per-shard position as the SAME-SHARD
// tiebreak): shards are per-clone files enumerated in FILENAME order (a second
// shard appears after a re-clone or on another machine), so cross-shard position
// carries no execution-order information. Within one shard the timestamps are
// non-decreasing and the position tiebreak preserves append order, which is what
// makes same-second events (the common case: one human turn drives mint + gate +
// resolution inside one second) resolve by execution order. When a candidate
// latest human turn shares one second-precision timestamp with ANY latest
// resolution in a DIFFERENT shard, execution order is unknowable and the check
// fails CLOSED (require a fresh turn) rather than let shard-filename order pick
// a winner. Fail-open when no ledger exists (no presence tracking yet on this
// harness).
//
// The resolution boundary is workflow-global (the most recent gate approval,
// rejection, answered question, summary confirmation, or autonomous grant).
// This makes a same-turn cascade across DIFFERENT stages refuse correctly;
// there is no per-stage scoping. AUTONOMY_MODE_SET only counts when its Mode is
// autonomous because that grant consumes the human turn that unlocks downstream

// engine dir (vision §7). An intent records the repos it touches in its
// intents.json row (`repos`); construction targets a specific one. P7 decouples
// "the repo to operate on" from "the single projectDir": before P7 the worktree
// tool ran `git worktree add` in the projectDir's own cwd (assuming projectDir IS
// the repo); now `--repo <name>` anchors it to the sibling repo dir instead.
//
// repoDir resolves the on-disk dir for a repo name; it does NOT validate that the
// dir exists or is a git repo (the caller does, where the git op runs).

// A repo name is a single path segment (no separators, no `..`) so it can only

// --- Workspace source fingerprint (#629) -----------------------------------
//
// A reviewer receipt for a `workspace_requires` stage (code-generation) must be
// bound to the SOURCE STATE the reviewer actually inspected: workspace writes
// deliberately emit no audit events (aidlc-audit-logger.ts excludes them), so
// without a binding a post-review source edit leaves the receipt satisfying the
// completion guard for code nobody re-reviewed. The binding is a git-native
// content fingerprint: per repo, a `git write-tree` over a TEMPORARY index
// seeded from HEAD with `git add -A` applied — the exact tracked + untracked
// (gitignore-respecting) content state, computed without touching the real
// index or worktree. Reverting an edit restores the original fingerprint
// (content-addressed), so an undone change does not strand a receipt.
//
// Multi-repo: the intent's recorded repo set (intentRepos), each resolved via
// repoDir(); no recorded repos = the legacy single-repo default (projectDir).
// Returns null when ANY target dir is not a usable git checkout. New receipts
// record that explicitly as `unbindable` and completion fails closed; only a
// legacy receipt with no fingerprint field keeps the migration fail-open.

// The record tree and the CLI/IDE workspace shell are anchored at the top level
// of the dir that CARRIES the shell: the workspace roof, or a Bolt worktree
// (which holds its own record mirror). For a multi-repo intent `aidlc/` is a
// SIBLING of the repo dirs (resolveConstructionRepo / repoDir) and
// `.aidlc/worktrees/` (worktreePath) hangs off the roof - neither is ever
// legitimately inside a fingerprinted repo or submodule, where a directory of
// those names is application source (#646 review). The trailing slash keeps the
// pathspec a directory match, so a root FILE named `aidlc` stays in the walk.
const AIDLC_SHELL_DIR_NAMES = ["aidlc/", ".aidlc/"];

// The sensor cache is the one member of the family that is NOT root-anchored:
// the type-check sensor anchors `.aidlc-sensors/.tsbuildinfo` at the tsconfig
// dir (core/tools/aidlc-sensor-type-check.ts's `sensorsDir`), which a
// monorepo's per-package tsconfig can put anywhere under repoDir. So this one
// needs a depth-tolerant pathspec while the shell names stay root-anchored.
//
// #646 review - the shell/any-depth split is deliberate, not an oversight: an
// earlier fix applied `**/<name>/**` to ALL four names to close a *reported*
// nested-.aidlc-sensors leak, but that pathspec matches the literal directory
// name at ANY depth - including a directory that is genuinely part of the
// application, coincidentally named `aidlc`/`.aidlc` for reasons unrelated to
// this framework's own shell (e.g. `src/aidlc/parser.ts`, a real feature named
// after the methodology). That silently dropped real source from the
// fingerprint - reproduced: `workspaceSourceFingerprint` was unchanged after
// adding tracked content under `src/aidlc/`.
//
// Depth tolerance is NOT permission to match the leaf name alone (#646 review,
// later round): a bare `**/.aidlc-sensors/**` excludes ANY directory of that
// name, so an application tracking source under a dot-prefixed,
// framework-named directory (`src/.aidlc-sensors/shipped.ts`) could be edited
// or deleted without moving the fingerprint. Match the cache by the path the
// engine actually writes instead of by its leaf. Every writer resolves through
// `sensorsDir()` -> `docsRoot()` -> `intentsDir()` -> `workspaceRoot()`, so the
// cache is always `<anchor>/aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents[/<record>]/
// .aidlc-sensors/` - the `<anchor>` is what varies (roof, Bolt worktree, or a
// monorepo package's tsconfig dir), which is exactly what the leading `**/`
// absorbs. The inner `/**/` also matches zero directories, covering the flat
// (no active record) form the type-check anchor produces.

// the stage executes against the bytes the reviewer read, so those are what the
// receipt has to bind. Fold a raw (`--no-filters`) hash of exactly the paths a
// clean driver touches into the fingerprint.
//
// Scoped by attribute AND configured driver, because both are required for a
// filter to run at all: a `.gitattributes` naming `filter=tidy` is inert unless

// differ once the driver is removed). That is also why this is not injectable
// by someone pushing to the repository, and why the scan costs one `check-attr`
// on a repo that filters nothing. `hash-object` runs WITHOUT `-w`: the oid is
// computed, never written into the caller's object store.
//
// Not covered, deliberately: end-of-line conversion (`core.autocrlf`, `text`,

// The Stop hook's tier-3 conversational carve-out asks one question: "was the
// ending turn the human's last prompt answered with NO workflow-engine
// engagement?". On Claude and Codex the Stop payload carries `transcript_path`
// and the hook reads that question straight off the transcript. Kiro (IDE and
// CLI) and opencode deliver NO transcript and expose no per-turn history to a
// hook at all, so the carve-out was inert there: every purely conversational
// turn mid-stage fell through to the cap-bounded block and earned a spurious
// forwarding-loop nudge.
//
// These two mtime markers reconstruct the same predicate from the filesystem:
//
//   .aidlc-human-turn   — touched by the UserPromptSubmit mint, once per human
//                         prompt, alongside the HUMAN_TURN ledger event.
//   .aidlc-engine-touch — touched by aidlc-orchestrate on every ADVANCING
//                         invocation (`next` / `report` / `park`).
//
//   conversational  <=>  mtime(.aidlc-human-turn) > mtime(.aidlc-engine-touch)
//
// Why markers and not the audit ledger: `next` is read-only and emits NO audit
// event, so a ledger-only predicate is BLIND to the exact failure the forwarding
// loop exists to catch — a conductor that consulted the engine and then bailed
// mid-loop. The engine marker sees it.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING SUBTLETY: the Stop hook consults the engine ITSELF (it runs
// `aidlc-orchestrate next` to learn whether work is pending). If that probe
// touched the engine marker, the engine mtime would ALWAYS be newer than the
// human mtime and the predicate would be false forever — the carve-out would
// look implemented and do nothing. The probe is therefore marked with
// STOP_HOOK_PROBE_ENV and the engine skips the touch when it sees it.

// MUTUAL-EXCLUSION SAFETY (compare-and-swap steal): the staleness DECISION (read

// a competing waiter can reap + re-mkdir + stamp a FRESH LIVE lock at the same
// path in between. A "re-read stamp THEN rename" guard shrinks but does NOT
// eliminate the window — the competitor can still re-acquire between the re-read
// and the rename, and the rename then robs the fresh live holder (two concurrent
// holders → lost update). So the steal is a true CAS keyed on the OS-atomic
// rename:
//
//   1. Rename lockDir aside to a reaper-PRIVATE nonce path. renameSync is the
//      atomic arbiter — exactly one process moves a given dir; the losers get
//      ENOENT and fall back to a normal mkdir retry. After this we hold the
//      moved dir EXCLUSIVELY (no other process can see it under the nonce name).
//   2. Read the owner stamp INSIDE the moved dir and compare against `judged`
//      (the identity we decided was stale). If it MATCHES, the dir we grabbed is
//      the same stale lock we judged → legitimate steal → remove it, return true.
//   3. If it does NOT match, a competitor reaped the stale dir and re-acquired a
//      FRESH lock at lockDir between our decision and our rename — we just moved
//      THEIR live lock. Restore it: rename the nonce dir back to lockDir. If that
//      restore fails (yet another process already re-mkdir'd lockDir in the gap),
//      the live lock already exists again at lockDir, so just drop our private
//      copy. Either way we return false WITHOUT having robbed a live holder.
//
// This preserves both invariants atomically — a live (fresh, under-threshold)
// holder is never destroyed, and exactly one reaper ever frees a given stale dir.
//
// RESIDUAL (documented, not silently shipped): the only remaining mutual-
// exclusion gap is the restore in step 3 — between renaming a wrongly-grabbed
// fresh lock OUT of lockDir and renaming it BACK, a third process can mkdir
// lockDir (seeing it momentarily empty); the restore then fails EEXIST and two
// processes briefly believe they hold the lock. This requires THREE specific
// interleavings in a sub-microsecond rename↔mkdir window (a competitor must
// re-acquire before our first rename, AND a third process must mkdir between our
// two renames) — orders of magnitude narrower than the pre-CAS decide→rename
// window, and the lock protects an idempotent audit-first transaction (re-run
// safe). A kernel-atomic compare-and-swap on a directory does not exist in

//   that admits every other kind: a FIFO with no writer blocks forever (and if
//   the caller holds a lock, it blocks the whole workspace with it), and a
//   character device such as /dev/zero never reaches EOF, so the read grows a
//   buffer until the process dies of ENOMEM.
//
//   TIME. `lstat(path)` then `readFileSync(path)` validates one file and reads
//   another if something swapped the name in between — and readFileSync follows
//   symlinks, so the swap can redirect the read to any file this process can
//   read. Opening ONCE with O_NOFOLLOW and fstat-ing THAT descriptor makes the
//   identity checked the identity read; there is no second resolution to race.
//
