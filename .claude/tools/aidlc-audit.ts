// approval. Recovers Fork Boundary + Source Audit Hash from the worktree's
// AUDIT_FORKED entry, sanity-checks the prefix-hash against main audit's
// current first-`boundary` bytes (refuses on mismatch — catches mid-Bolt
// tampering or main-audit truncation), then appends the post-fork delta and
// emits AUDIT_MERGED.
//
// Delta detection is parse-driven: locate the AUDIT_FORKED block in the
// worktree audit, take everything after that block's "\n---\n" separator.
// The Fork Boundary field is used solely as the prefix-hash anchor, NOT for
// delta math (the worktree audit's copy of AUDIT_FORKED extends beyond
// `boundary` by the entry's own size; trusting `boundary` for delta-start
// would duplicate AUDIT_FORKED on merge-back).
//
// Lock budget: extended from acquireAuditLock's 5s default to 20s
// (200 retries × 100ms) to absorb N=4-8 Bolt-merge contention in workshop
// scenarios.

// One lock guards prefix validation, retry detection, and the combined
// delta+AUDIT_MERGED append. The retry pre-check runs immediately before that
// append; post-write verification order stays unchanged.
