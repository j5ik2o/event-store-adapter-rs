// Stage-graph library + CLI. Exports the 8-function API consumed by
// the doctor handler (see aidlc-utility.ts handleDoctor) and the
// runtime resolution layer (lib.ts's nextInScopeStage,
// firstInScopeStageOfPhase, stagesInScope delegate here via lazy
// require).
//
// Architectural model (see docs/reference/15-stage-definition.md):
//   - The graph is structural truth: 31 stage definitions + every
//     requires_stage / produces / consumes edge they declare = the
//     complete DAG. Compiled from YAML into stage-graph.json.
//   - A scope is a sub-DAG: scope-mapping.json's EXECUTE slice +
//     whichever requires_stage edges exist among those nodes.
//   - The serial runtime linearizes each sub-DAG to numeric order for
//     iteration. Numeric order is a valid topological sort of the full
//     graph (proven by t65 assertion 17; protected by compile's
//     edge-local invariant check below). The future worktree scheduler
//     will consume the sub-DAG structure directly for parallel Bolts.
//   - topoSort and findCycles exist in the library for analysis
//     (doctor consumes them) and for future scheduling; they do not
//     gate runtime iteration today.
//
// Compile is the YAML -> JSON transform. It bootstraps number + name
// from today's stage-graph.json so YAML stays the authored source of
// truth for everything else while computed fields stay computed. Numbers
// are ALWAYS assigned by the engine, never claimed by authors — a plugin's
// authored `number:` is a relative-ordering hint among its own new stages,
// its absolute value never used, so uncoordinated plugins cannot collide.
//
// A NEW stage slug (a .md on disk with no row in stage-graph.json yet) is
// seeded on compile rather than rejected: each phase's batch of new
// stages is ordered by its own requires_stage edges (Kahn's algorithm;
// ties among independent stages break by the authored `number:` hint,
// then slug), then assigned next-free contiguous indices
// (`<PHASES.indexOf(phase)>.<maxIndexInPhase + 1>` onward); name comes
// from authored `name:`, defaulting to the title-cased slug. Both are
// written into the regenerated JSON, so the FIRST compile assigns them
// and every subsequent compile harvests the pinned values, the assignment
// happens once and is stable thereafter. An author who wants a hand-tuned
// display name edits that one JSON field after the seeding compile; the
// next compile preserves it. Renumbering an existing stage is still an
// explicit JSON edit. (Seeding only ever ADDS rows, it never renumbers a
// stage that already has a row, so an in-flight workflow's slug-keyed
// state is safe.)
//
