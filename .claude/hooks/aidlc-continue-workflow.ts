// Stop hook: enforce the forwarding loop on turn-end.
//
// This is one of the framework's flow-altering hooks. The advisory hooks
// observe (audit, sensors, statusline, state
// validation) and always exit 0. The run-sensors hook in particular carries
// an explicit advisory contract: it NEVER returns {decision: block} (its own
// contract, asserted by t95 Case 7 — not a framework ban). This hook is a
// DIFFERENT, sanctioned contract: it may emit {"decision":"block", ...} to
// keep the interactive forwarding loop running until the engine says `done`.
//
// Why it exists. The forwarding loop is the conductor (LLM) calling the engine
// for the next move, acting on it, and reporting. On the gated/interactive
// path the conductor holds the loop because only it can ask the human a
// question. If the conductor forgets to consult the engine — after a long
// conversation, or by improvising — the workflow drifts. So the loop cannot
// rest on the conductor's good behaviour: when the conductor tries to end its
// turn, this hook runs the engine (`aidlc-orchestrate next`) and, if a
// directive is still PENDING, blocks the stop and injects the directive back
// via `reason`. The conductor cannot quit until the engine answers `done`.
// Enforced by the harness, not by the LLM remembering.
//
// The reason is an ON-TASK CONTINUATION — it names the work the conductor
// still owes (run the loop, act on the directive, report), never an
// override-shaped instruction. That phrasing is the security property:
// override-shaped directives are refused by the conductor's own safety
// training, so a buggy or compromised engine can only ever CONTINUE sanctioned
// work, never hijack the session.
//
// Two bounds keep a stuck loop from trapping the session (a stuck block is the
// ONE way to trap a session, so this is the safety-critical part):
//   1. `stop_hook_active` — Claude Code sets this true when the current stop is
//      itself the product of a prior Stop-hook block. We read it as a signal
//      that we are already inside a blocked sequence.
//   2. A NO-PROGRESS counter — consecutive blocks with no intervening workflow
//      advance (the stable state digest and pending-directive fingerprint are both
//      unchanged). It is persisted across the rapid-fire blocks in a transient
//      file under aidlc-docs/.aidlc-stop-hook/. Under a no-progress ceiling
//      exposed as CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP, once the count reaches the cap
//      we LET GO (allow the stop). The default ceiling is run-mode aware: an
//      unattended autonomous Construction run keeps the long ceiling (8, the
//      loop must run to completion with no human to release it), while an
//      INTERACTIVE run uses a low ceiling (2, issue #365 itself recommends
//      BLOCK_CAP=2 as the workaround) so a human who just wants to pause/chat is
//      released after one nudge, not eight. When workflow state or the pending
//      directive advances, the signature changes and the counter resets to 0,
//      so a healthy loop is never throttled.
//
// Six human-wait carve-outs keep the hook from punishing a turn that ended
// *because* it is waiting on the human (or is simply conversational):
//   1. The Esc interrupt is FREE: Stop hooks do not fire on user interrupt, so
//      an Esc can never be trapped — no code needed for that case.
//   2. The interactive GATE is not free: the Stop hook DOES fire when the
//      conductor ends its turn to await an `AskUserQuestion` answer. At an
//      approval gate ([?] awaiting-approval) or in the Request-Changes loop
//      ([R] revising) the engine still returns a pending run-stage (the stage is
//      in-flight, aidlc-orchestrate.ts:1161-1176), so without a carve-out the
//      hook would block and spam the forwarding-loop nudge until the cap bleeds
//      out. So when the current stage's checkbox is positively [?]/[R] we ALLOW
//      the stop (isHumanWaitStop below). Positive-confirmation only and
//      fail-open: stateless cases fall through to the cap-bounded block.
//   3. A mid-stage CLARIFYING QUESTION parks the stage at [-] in-progress — the
//      same state as a lazy quit, so [-] alone can't be carved out. But the
//      conductor must write a `<slug>-questions.md` with blank [Answer]: tags
//      before asking (stage-protocol.md §3); an unanswered tag is a positive
//      signal that a question is pending, so we ALLOW the stop then too
//      (isPendingQuestionStop below). The active directive stage selects the
//      questions file because a unit-major walk can run ahead of Current Stage.
//      Autonomous Construction stays guarded except for unit-major
//      code-generation's mandatory Plan Approval. Any miss falls through to the
//      cap-bounded block, so a genuine mid-stage quit is still nudged.
//   4. A LOGGED NON-GATE QUESTION has a current-stage DECISION_RECORDED with no
//      later QUESTION_ANSWERED. This is the positive signal for structured
//      questions that do not live in the stage questions file (notably the
//      learnings ritual), and for harnesses that render questions as prose.
//      Like the pending-file carve-out, it is limited to [-] and suppressed
//      under autonomous Construction.
//   5. A CONVERSATIONAL turn ends with the human's last prompt answered and NO
//      workflow-engine engagement (the conductor ran neither aidlc-orchestrate
//      nor aidlc-state since that prompt). Issue #365's broader reading: a human
//      who just wants to CHAT mid-workflow should not be nudged at all. We ALLOW
//      the stop when the most recent genuine human prompt was answered with zero
//      engine calls (isConversationalStop below). ONE predicate, TWO evidence
//      sources: the harness TRANSCRIPT where the Stop payload delivers
//      `transcript_path` (Claude, Codex), and the `.aidlc-human-turn` vs
//      `.aidlc-engine-touch` MARKER mtimes where it does not (Kiro IDE, Kiro CLI,
//      opencode — these expose no turn history to a hook at all, so the framework
//      writes the two facts itself on the mint and engine seams). The marker path
//      depends on the engine skipping its touch for this hook's OWN `next` probe
//      (STOP_HOOK_PROBE_ENV); without that the predicate would be false forever.
//      POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION only and fail-closed on both paths: it never fires
//      under autonomous Construction, and any engine call in the responding turn,
//      an unreadable transcript, a missing marker, no human prompt found, or any
//      parse miss falls through to the cap-bounded block. It only ever ALLOWS;
//      it can never block more.
//        NOT FULL PARITY. The marker path answers the same question more
//        COARSELY than the transcript: it is blind to aidlc-jump / aidlc-bolt /
//        aidlc-swarm and the mutating aidlc-state verbs, which the transcript
//        DOES count as engagement, because none of those tools touch the engine
//        marker. A conductor that jumps the pointer and then quits is released
//        here and blocked on Claude. Narrow but real; see the coverage-gap note
//        on markEngineTouch in aidlc-lib.ts.
//   6. A RESUME CHOICE has a state-bound active-directive marker with kind
//      `ask` and resume status `waiting`. On the shared non-Copilot path we must
//      read this latch BEFORE probing `next`, because the probe publishes its
//      own sessionless directive and can overwrite the `ask` kind. We ALLOW the
//      stop while the human chooses how to resume. Autonomous Construction is
//      guarded and falls through to the cap-bounded block.
//
// No-op outside AIDLC. The frontmatter Stop matcher scopes this to the `aidlc`
// skill, but we defend here too: with no active workflow (no aidlc-state.md
// under the project dir) we exit 0 immediately. A non-AIDLC session is NEVER
// blocked. Any unexpected error also falls through to allow the stop — failing
// open is the only safe failure mode for a hook that can otherwise trap a turn.

// --- Human-wait carve-out -----------------------------------------------------
//
// The block path punishes a conductor that quit mid-loop. But a conductor parked
// at an approval gate or in the Request-Changes loop has ALSO ended its turn with
// the engine still returning a pending directive — and from the engine's vantage
// it looks identical, because a stage in `awaiting-approval` ([?]) or `revising`
// ([R]) is still "in-flight", so `next` re-emits a run-stage for it
// (aidlc-orchestrate.ts:1161-1176). Yet these states exist BECAUSE the human was
// engaged: [?] only because a gate is open awaiting approve/reject, [R] only
// because changes were just requested. Blocking there spams the forwarding-loop
// nudge until the cap bleeds out — confusing and unprofessional at an
// interactive gate.
//
// So when the CURRENT stage's checkbox is positively in one of those states,
// allow the stop. This is the only safe widening of an allow: it can only ever
// make the hook release MORE readily, never block more.
//
// One honest caveat on [R]: the row stays `revising` across the WHOLE rework
// window (it flips back to [?] only when the conductor calls `revise`; see
// stage-protocol.md:164). So [R] covers both the human-wait prompt ("what would
// you like changed?") AND the autonomous rework edits that follow. Allowing the
// stop on [R] means a conductor that quits mid-rework is not nudged — the same
// [-]-style ambiguity we accept for in-progress, here scoped to a window the
// human just opened. It is still only ever an allow (never blocks more), and the
// dominant [R] experience is the human-wait prompt this carve-out targets.
//
// POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION ONLY. We allow ONLY when a checkbox row for the current
// slug exists AND its state is [?]/[R]. No rows, slug not found, or any other
// state → return false and fall through. [-] in-progress is NOT carved out HERE:
// it is also the normal "stage work still owed" state, indistinguishable from a
// lazy mid-stage quit by checkbox alone, so a blanket [-] carve-out would gut
// the hook. (A mid-stage [-] stage with a genuinely pending question is handled
// separately and conservatively by isPendingQuestionStop below, which keys off
// the conductor's questions file rather than checkbox state.) Any parse error
// falls through too: fail-open is the only safe failure mode for a hook that can
// otherwise trap a turn.

// --- Tier-2: pending mid-stage question carve-out -----------------------------
//
// A clarifying question asked mid-stage leaves the stage at [-] in-progress —
// the SAME checkbox state as a conductor that lazily quit, so [-] alone cannot
// be carved out (tier 1 deliberately left it to the cap). But there IS a
// conductor-emitted artifact that disambiguates: stage-protocol.md §3 mandates a
// `<slug>-questions.md` is created (Step 1) with blank `[Answer]:` tags before
// the conductor asks, and every tag is filled before the stage proceeds (Step
// 4). So a questions file with an UNANSWERED tag means a question is genuinely
// pending — the conductor is parked on the human, exactly like a gate.
//
// Two strict gates make this safe (it can still only ever ALLOW, never block
// more):
//   1. POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION — allow only when a `<slug>-questions.md` under the
//      active directive stage's canonical dir, or the exact active-unit dir
//      carried by a Construction directive, has at least one `[Answer]:` tag
//      that is empty or underscores-only. No file, all answered, or any read
//      error → false (fall through to the cap).
//   2. AUTONOMY GUARD — never fires under autonomous Construction except for
//      unit-major code-generation. That mode suppresses the autonomous swarm
//      and routes code-generation through the interactive per-unit walk, whose
//      Plan Approval is mandatory. Every other autonomous path must keep running
//      unattended, so a stray open question cannot strand the run.
// Fail-open throughout: any error returns false and the cap-bounded block stands.

// True when the `<slug>-questions.md` under the active stage dir has an
// unanswered tag.
// An `[Answer]:` line is "unanswered" when, after the colon, only whitespace or
// underscores remain (stage-protocol.md:333 — "blank or contains only
// underscores"). Standard stages use `<record>/<phase>/<slug>/`; a per-unit
// Construction directive carries its exact unit and uses
// `<record>/construction/<unit>/<slug>/`. We never recursively accept a question

// the unit currently named by the engine.

// --- Tier-2b: pending in-flight compose proposal carve-out --------------------
//
// The adaptive composer's IN-FLIGHT approve/edit/reject gate is a turn-stop
// like a stage gate, but it has no [?]/[R] checkbox signal: the current stage
// stays [ ]/[-], so this hook's bare-`next` probe sees the pending run-stage
// and would block the turn - shoving the conductor back into stage execution
// mid-compose and abandoning the gate (the mid-workflow trap class, reopened
// for compose). POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION: the conductor writes the marker file
// `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending` before presenting the gate (the engine's
// compose dispatch print instructs it) and deletes it on approve/reject, the
// same disk-signal discipline as tier-2's <slug>-questions.md. AUTONOMY GUARD:
// never fires under autonomous Construction (an unattended run has no human to
// answer the gate; a stray marker must not strand it). Fail-open: any read
// error falls through to the cap-bounded block. Front/report composes are
// unaffected (cold start has no state file; the hook allows before this).
//
// STALENESS BOUND. The conductor owns the write/delete, but a session that
// crashes or is killed between "write the marker" and "gate resolves" leaves the
// marker on disk forever - a permanently open carve-out that silently disables
// the forwarding-loop enforcement for the whole workspace until someone
// hand-deletes a hidden file they have never heard of. So the carve-out honours
// the marker ONLY while it is FRESH: younger than COMPOSE_MARKER_TTL_MS by its
// mtime. The window is generous (24h) so a human who steps away from an open
// gate for a long pause is still covered; anything older is an orphan, not a
// live gate. A stale marker is IGNORED (fall through to the cap-bounded block)
// AND best-effort deleted here (the janitor), so the next turn starts clean.
// The delete is wrapped so a failure to unlink never changes the stop decision.

// --- Tier-3: conversational-turn carve-out (issue #365 broader reading) -------
//
// Issue #365's literal fix is `park` (the conductor explicitly pauses the run).
// But the reported pain is broader: during an ACTIVE workflow a human who just
// wants to CHAT (ask a question, discuss a decision, course-correct) should
// not be nudged back into the forwarding loop at all. Park does not cover that
// (it is not automatic). This carve-out does: when the turn that is ending was
// CONVERSATIONAL (the most recent genuine human prompt was answered with NO
// workflow-engine engagement, i.e. the conductor ran neither aidlc-orchestrate
// nor aidlc-state since that prompt) we ALLOW the stop.
//
// The signal is the harness transcript. Claude and Codex both deliver a
// `transcript_path` on the Stop payload (Claude JSONL; Codex date-sharded
// rollout JSONL); Kiro delivers none, so on Kiro this carve-out is simply inert
// and the run-mode-aware low interactive cap (blockCap) is the safety net that
// releases a chatting human after one nudge instead of eight.
//
// Two strict gates make this safe (it can still only ever ALLOW, never block
// more), mirroring isPendingQuestionStop:
//   1. POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION: allow only on a transcript we could read that
//      shows a genuine human prompt answered with zero engine calls. A missing
//      path, unreadable file, no human prompt found, or ANY engine call in the
//      responding turn returns false (fall through to the cap-bounded block).
//   2. AUTONOMY GUARD: never fires under autonomous Construction. There the
//      loop must keep running unattended; there is no human chatting to release.
// Fail-closed throughout: any error returns false and the cap-bounded block stands.

// True when a user-role transcript entry's text is actually the hook's OWN
// injected continuation (a re-prompt after a block), not the human talking.
// Two shapes: Claude Code wraps the block reason as "Stop hook feedback: ..."
// (isMeta:true), but other harnesses (Codex) may re-inject the RAW reason text
// with no wrapper. continuationReason() (below) always opens with "The AIDLC
// workflow has a pending step" and names "the workflow loop", so match either
// signature. Excluding these is what keeps an engine-engaged turn whose last
// user entry is the hook's nudge from being misread as a fresh human prompt.
// The two phrases MUST stay in step with continuationReason(): if its wording
// changes without this matcher changing too, an injected nudge reads as a fresh
// human prompt and the conversational carve-out silently mis-allows the stop.

//
//   - TRANSCRIPT (Claude, Codex): the Stop payload carries `transcript_path`, so
//     the turn history is read directly and classified per tool call. Highest
//     fidelity; preferred whenever available.
//   - MARKER mtimes (Kiro IDE, Kiro CLI, opencode): these harnesses deliver NO
//     transcript and expose no turn history to a hook at all, so the same
//     predicate is reconstructed from two files the framework already writes on
//     the relevant seams — `.aidlc-human-turn` (the UserPromptSubmit mint) and
//     `.aidlc-engine-touch` (every advancing aidlc-orchestrate invocation). A
//     human turn NEWER than the last engine advance is the marker spelling of
//     "answered with zero engine calls".
//
// Before the marker path existed this returned false on every transcript-free
// harness, so tier 3 was inert there and the low interactive cap was the only
// net — meaning exactly one spurious forwarding-loop nudge per conversational
// detour, on the very interaction AI-DLC wants to encourage (a human
// interrogating the process mid-stage).
//
// POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION AND FAIL-CLOSED on both paths, unchanged: an autonomous
// Construction run, a missing/unreadable transcript, a missing/unreadable marker,
// no human prompt found, or ANY engine engagement in the responding turn all
