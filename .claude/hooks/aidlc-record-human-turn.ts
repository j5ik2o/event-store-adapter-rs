// UserPromptSubmit hook: record a HUMAN_TURN event (human-presence gate).
//
// On every real human prompt, append a HUMAN_TURN event to the active intent's
// audit shard (the state machine's own append-only ledger). The approval /
// interview gate (handleApprove / handleAnswer) refuses unless a HUMAN_TURN was
// recorded since the last gate resolution, so a model under autopilot cannot
// fabricate an approval with no human having acted this turn.
//
// Presence-only: the prompt text is irrelevant, so stdin is not read.
// appendAuditEntry resolves the active intent from the on-disk cursor using only
// the project dir (no payload needed). No workflow state on disk means nothing
// to gate, so the hook exits without writing (same self-gate as
// aidlc-session-start.ts) - otherwise every prompt in a project that carries the
// harness shell but never ran the framework would scaffold and grow audit
// shards. The gate fails open on an empty ledger, so skipping the mint there is
// safe. The mint is fail-open (try/catch, exit 0): a mint failure must never
// block the human's turn.
//
// The same seam also touches the .aidlc-human-turn marker (markHumanTurn). The
// ledger event serves the human-presence GATE; the marker serves the Stop hook's
// conversational carve-out, which needs a cheap "when was the last human prompt,
// relative to the last engine advance?" comparison that works on harnesses
// delivering no transcript. Both are written from this one seam so they can never
// disagree about when a human spoke. See the marker family in aidlc-lib.ts.
